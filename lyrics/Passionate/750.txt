You know the day destroys the night 
Night divides the day 
Tried to run 
Tried to hide 
Break on through to the other side 
Break on through to the other side 
Break on through to the other side, yeah 

We chased our pleasures here 
Dug our treasures there 
But can you still recall 
The time we cried 
Break on through to the other side 
Break on through to the other side 

Yeah! 
C'mon, yeah 

Everybody loves my baby 
Everybody loves my baby 
She get(s high) 
She get(s high) 
She get(s high) 
She get(s high) 

I found an island in your arms 
Country in your eyes 
Arms that chain 
Eyes that lie 
Break on through to the other side 
Break on through to the other side 
Break on through, oww! 
Oh, yeah! 

Made the scene 
Week to week 
Day to day 
Hour to hour 
The gate is straight 
Deep and wide 
Break on through to the other side 
Break on through to the other side 
Break on through 
Break on through 
Break on through 
Break on through 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
