Gretel said "Oh you feel so bad 
I know you feel so bad"

Handsome Gretel 
I vacuumed out my head 
Jumping from bed to bed my name is Gretel 
A soul of metal 
My name is Gretel yeah 
I've got a sloppy slot 
Handsome Gretel

And symbolize everything that is disgust and mistrust 
Licorice eyes
