Coming down
Sadie I love it
Now now now
Death valley 69
You're right you're right you're right
I was on the wrong track
We're deep in the valley
How deep in the gulley
And now in the canyon
Way out in the yonder
She started to holler
I didn't wanna
I didn't wanna
But she started to holler
So I had to hit it
Hit it, hit it, hit it
Deep in the valley
In the trunk of an old car
I got sand in my mouth
And you got sun in yr eyes
Blinded
And you wanted to get there
But I couldn't go faster
I couldn't go faster
I couldn't go faster
So I started to hit it
I started to hit it
Hit it
Hit it
