In the city there's a thousand things i want to say to you
But whenever i approach you, you make me look a fool
I wanna say, i wanna tell you
About the young ideas
But you turn them into fears
In the city there's a thousand faces all shining bright
And those golden faces are under 25
They wanna say, they gonna tell ya
About the young idea
You better listen now you've said your bit-a

And i know what you're thinking

You still think i am crap
But you'd better listen man
Because the kids know where it's at

In the city there's a thousand men in uniforms
And i've heard they now have the right to kill a man
We wanna say, we gonna tell ya
About the young idea
And if it don't work, at least we said we've tried

In the city, in the city
In the city there's a thousand things i want to say to you
