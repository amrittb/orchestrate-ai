Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands

He's the one
Who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
knows not what it means
When I say
He's the one
Who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
knows not what it means
and I say yeah

We can have some more
Nature is a whore
Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom

He's the one
Who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
knows not what it means
When I say
He's the one
Who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
knows not what it means
and I say yeah

He's the one
who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means

And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he dont know what it means
