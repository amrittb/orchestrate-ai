Wake up, got another day to get through now 
Got another man to see 
Got to call him on the telephone 
Got to find a piece of paper 

Sit down, got another letter to write 
Think I'll got to get the letter just right 
There's a ringing on the telephone 
Oh no, got to write a little later 
No such day as tomorrow, only one two three go! 

Time - got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head 
Time - got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head 
Time - got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head 
Tickin' in my head, tickin' in my head, tickin' in my head 

If I tell you what I'm doing today 
Will you shut up and get out of my way? 
Someone asked me what the time is, 
I don't know 
Only know I gotta go now 

No time - trying to get a watch repaired 
No time - never got a thing to wear 
Hear the ringin' of the telephone no no 
Hear a ringin' in my head now 
No such thing as tomorrow, only one two three go! 

Time - got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head 
Time - got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head 
Time - got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head 
Tickin' in my head, tickin' in my head, tickin' in my head 

Time - got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head 
Time - got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head 
Time - got the time tick-tick-tickin' in my head 
Tickin' in my head, tickin' in my head, tickin' in my head
