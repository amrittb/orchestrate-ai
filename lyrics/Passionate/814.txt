I got you, that's all I want
I won't forget, that's a whole lot
I don't go out, not now that you're in
Sometimes we shout, but that's no problem

I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell that I'm not lyin'

Look at you, you're a pageant
You're everything, that I've imagined
Something's wrong, I feel uneasy
You show me, tell me you're not teasin'

I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell that I'm not lyin'
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell that I'm not lyin'

There's no doubt, not when I'm with you
When I'm without, I stay in my room
Where do you go, I get no answer
You're always out, it gets on my nerves

I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell that I'm not lyin'
But I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell that I'm not lyin'

I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell that I'm not lyin'
