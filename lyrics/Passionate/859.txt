I'll be grazing by your window
Please come pat me on the head
I just want to find out what you're nice to me for
When I look up don't think I don't know
About all the scabs you dread
It's hard to stomach the gore

I know you don't have the patience
To peel 'em off no more
In a jar where you fed me
All I could do was lick your hand
In a jar the scars are plain to see
I hope somehow you'll know I understand

I'll be grazing by your window
Please come pat me on the head
I just want to find out what you're nice to me for
Then you smile and decide to take me in
'Cause I look cute by your bed
But I can feel it just a little more

I'll watch you fall apart, babe you know it
You know I'm young and stuff, babe don't blow it
Just unscrew the top yeah
Pick me up now just can't stop

In a jar where you fed me
All I could do was lick your hand
In a jar where scars are plain to see
I hope somehow you'll know I understand
Scabs collect beneath your bureau
From the knife wounds you got
