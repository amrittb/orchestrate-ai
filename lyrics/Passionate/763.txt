You look just like an Elvis from HELL
My heart is broken, so I'm gong to HELL
bury me way down deep in HELL
I'm a steel drivin' man, I want to go to HELL!

then go tell Ivy oh-oh!
for the love of Ivy yeah-yeah!
I did it for Ivy oh-oh!

you're the one

Gonna buy me a graveyard of my own
kill everyone who ever done me wrong
gonna buy me a gun just as long as my arm
kill everyone who ever done me harm

then go tell Ivy oh-oh!
for the love of Ivy yeah-heah!
I did it for Ivy oh-oh!

you're the one

Well, jawbone eat and jawbone talk
jawbone eat you with a knife and fork
I was hunting for niggers down in the dark
when suddenly I got a better thought

let's go hunt Ivy, oh-oh!
let's go get Ivy, Yeah-yeah!
for the love of Ivy, oh-oh!

you're the one.

I did it for Ivy
I did it for Ivy

I was all dressed up like Elvis from HELL! HELL!
