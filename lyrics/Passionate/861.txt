Now look out 
I took a record of pretty music 
I went down and baby you can tell 
I took a record of pretty music 
Now I'm putting it to you straight from hell 
I'll stick it deep inside 
I'll stick it deep inside 
Cause I'm loose 
I feel fine to be dancin', baby 
I feel fine, I'm a shakin' leaf 
I feel fine to be dancin', baby 
Cause it's love, yeah I do believe 
I'll stick it deep inside 
I'll stick it deep inside 
Cause I'm loose 
And I'll stick it deep inside 
And I'll stick it hey 
Well I'm loose, well I'm loose 
Well I'm loose
