I've called you so many times today 
And I guess it's all true what your girl-friends say 
That you don't ever want to see me again 
And your brother's gonna kill me and he's six feet ten 
I guess you'd call it cowardice 
But I'm not prepared to go on like this 

I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing 
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing 
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing you 
I can't stand losing you 
I can't stand losing you 
I can't stand losing you 

I see you sent my letters back 
And my L.P. records and they're all scratched 
I can't see the point in another day 
When nobody listens to a word I say 
You can call it lack of confidence 
But to carry on living doesn't make no sense 

I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing 
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing 
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing 
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing you 
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing 
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing 

I guess this is our last goodbye 
And you don't care, so I won't cry 
But you'll be sorry when I'm dead 
And all this guilt will be on your head 
I guess you'd call it suicide 
But I'm too full to swallow my pride 
I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing 
I can't, I can't...
