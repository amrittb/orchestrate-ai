I shut the windows and close the store
I lay down on the bathroom floor
Everyone I know is a bore.

I'm starting to think that everything stinks
That I could really use a drink
Then I got up and hit my head on the sink.

Father father father father, do you call
Father father father, should I end it all.

Now, here comes the song I love so much
Makes me want to go fuck shit up
Now, I got Nirvana in my head
I'm so glad I'm not dead
I slam my hand in the car door
I scream 'till I could scream no more
Bloody and mean and rotten to the core

Father father father father, do you call
Satan Satan Satan, should I end it all

You try to get off the ground
But you always end up coming down
When the sound comes around and goes in your ears
You can do anything you have no fears
When that sound comes around and goes in my ears
I can do anything I have no fears

Now, here comes the song I love so much
Makes me want to go fuck shit up
I got Nirvana in my head
I'm so glad I'm not dead

Here comes the song, I love it so much
Makes me want to go fuck shit up
Now, I got Nirvana in my head
I'm so glad I'm not dead
