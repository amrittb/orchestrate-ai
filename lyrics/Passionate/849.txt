Earth tone suits you
So give it a smile
If I could hold your feet down
Get to know for awhile

To make due is a promise
Hard to keep without help
Never taught to look in
I'm too concerned with my health

Help me spread right, ash is
Cow fertilized
Come down in a feed town
Strength to minimize

Hold it

In the meantime
