the girls won't touch me cuz I got a misdirection
living at night isn't helping my complexion
signs all said it's a social infection
ilttle bit a fun now I get an insurrection

my mom kicked me out till I get some pants that fit
she just won't approve of my strange kinda wit...
I get so excited I always gotta lose it
man they sent me off, man I'm takin cures

don't need a cure (x3)
need a final solution!
don't need a cure (x3)
need a final solution!

buy me a ticket to a sonic reduction
tires gonna sound like a nuclear destruction
seems I'm a victim of natural selection
meet me on the other side not a direction

don't need a cure (x3)
need a final solution
don't need a cure (x3)
need a final solution

solution...
solution...
solution...
solution!
