Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine 
Meltin' in a pot of thieves 
Wild card up my sleeve 
Thick heart of stone 
My sins my own 
They belong to me, me 

People say beware! 
But I don't care 
The words are just 
Rules and regulations to me, me 

I-I walk in a room, you know I look so proud 
I'm movin' in this here atmosphere, where anything's allowed 
And I go to this here party and I just get bored 
Until I look out the window, see a sweet young thing 
Humpin' on the parking meter, leanin' on the parking meter 
Oh, she looks so good, oh, she looks so fine 
And I got this crazy feeling and then I'm gonna ah-ah make her mine 
Ooh I'll put my spell on her 

Here she comes 
Walkin' down the street 
Here she comes 
Comin' through my door 
Here she comes 
Crawlin' up my stair 
Here she comes 
Waltzin' through the hall 
In a pretty red dress 
And oh, she looks so good, oh, she looks so fine 
And I got this crazy feeling that I'm gonna ah-ah make her mine 

And then I hear this knockin' on my door 
Hear this knockin' on my door 
And I look up into the big tower clock 
And say, &quot;Oh my God, here's midnight!&quot; 
And my baby is walkin' through the door 
Leanin' on my couch she whispers to me and I take the big plunge 
And oh, she was so good and oh, she was so fine 
And I'm gonna tell the world that I just ah-ah made her mine 

And I said darling, tell me your name, she told me her name
She whispered to me, she told me her name 
And her name is, and her name is, and her name is, and her name is G-L-O-R-I-A
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria

I was at the stadium 
There were twenty thousand girls called their names out to me 
Marie and Ruth but to tell you the truth 
I didn't hear them I didn't see 
I let my eyes rise to the big tower clock 
And I heard those bells chimin' in my heart 
Going ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong. 
Ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong 
Counting the time, then you came to my room 
And you whispered to me and we took the big plunge 
And oh. You were so good, oh, you were so fine 
And I gotta tell the world that I make her mine make her mine 
Make her mine make her mine make her mine make her mine 

G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria,
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria

And the tower bells chime, &quot;ding dong&quot; they chime 
They're singing, &quot;Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine.&quot; 

Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A,
Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A, G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria,
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria,
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria.
