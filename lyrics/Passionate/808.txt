Mother, you had me but I never had you,
I wanted you but you didn't want me,
So I, I just got to tell you,
Goodbye, goodbye.
Father, you left me but I never left you,
I needed you but you didn't need me,
So I, I just got to tell you,
Goodbye, goodbye.
Children, don't do what I have done,
I couldn't walk and I tried to run,
So I, I just got to tell you,
Goodbye, goodbye.
Mama don't go,
Daddy come home.
Mama don't go,
Daddy come home.
Mama don't go,
Daddy come home.
Mama don't go,
Daddy come home.
Mama don't go,
Daddy come home.
Mama don't go,
Daddy come home.
Mama don't go,
Daddy come home...
