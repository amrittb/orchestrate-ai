In a milk bar and feeling lost 
Drinking sodas as cold as frost 
Someone leans in my direction 
Quizzing on my jukebox selection 
What do you call that noise 
That you put on? 

This is pop 
Yeah yeah 

This is! 

On a walkway and moving fast 
All I get is transistor blast 
Someone leans in my direction 
Quizzing on my station selection 
What do you call that noise 
That you put on? 

This is pop 
Yeah yeah 

This is! 

We come the wrong way 
We come the long way 
We play the songs much too loud 

This is pop 
Yeah yeah
