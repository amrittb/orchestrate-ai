With a purposeful grimace and a terrible sound
He pulls the spitting high tension wires down
Helpless people on a subway train
Scream for God as he looks in on them
He picks up a bus and he throws it back down
As he wades through the buildings toward the center of town

Oh no, they say he's got to go 
Go go Godzilla, yeah
Oh no, there goes Tokyo 
Go go Godzilla, yeah

Oh no, they say he's got to go 
Go go Godzilla, yeah
Oh no, there goes Tokyo 
Go go Godzilla, yeah

Godzilla!
Godzilla!
Godzilla!

Oh no, they say he's got to go 
Go go Godzilla, yeah
