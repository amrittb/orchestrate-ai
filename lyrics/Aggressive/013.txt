I had a soul transplant operation 
Coz my bypass didn't function 
So now I'm keeping on my toes 
'Til I see your one man show 

Show me magic 
Show me magic 
Show me magic 
Show me mad 

Wouldn't it be nice to know 
What the paper doesn't show 
What the TV doesn't say 
And what my hamster's ate today? 

Show me magic 
Show me magic 
Show me magic 
Show me mad 

God! Show me magic 
God! Show me magic 
God! Show me magic 
God! Show me mad 

Show me magic 
Show me magic 
Show me magic 
Show me magic
