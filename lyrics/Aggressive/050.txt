Hey Grandma, you're so young
Your old man's just a boy 
Been a long time this time (pow-pow-pow)
Been a long time this time (pow-pow-pow)
Been a long time this time round, this time round
Everything is upside down, upside down
Sure lookin' good
You're lookin' so good
You're sure lookin' good

SF freak scene was on my mind
Fillmore Slim is just a-wasting time 
Well I got high this time (pow-pow-pow)
Well I got high this time (pow-pow-pow)
Well I got high this time round, this time round
Everything is upside down, upside down
Cause your lookin' good
You're lookin' so good
You're sure lookin' good

Robitussin make me feel so fine
Robitussin and Elderberry wine
Hey Grandma
Hey Grandma
Hey Grandma
Hey Grandma...
