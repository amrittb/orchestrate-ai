Don't you ever feel sad,
Lean on me when times are bad.
When the day comes and you're down,
In a river of trouble and about to drown

Just hold on, I'm comin',
Hold on, I'm comin'.

I'm goin' my way, your lover.
If you get cold I'll be your cover.
Don't have to worry `cause I'm here,
No need to suffer baby, I'm here.

'cause hold on, I'm comin',
hold on, I'm comin'.
hold on, I'm comin',
hold on, I'm comin'.

reach out to me for satisfaction,
call my name now for quick reaction.

Don't you ever feel sad,
lean on me when times are bad.
when the day comes and you're down,
in a river of trouble and about to drown,

just hold on, I'm comin',
hold on, I'm comin'.

just hold on, I'm comin',
hold on, I'm comin'.

just hold on, I'm comin',
hold on, I'm comin'.
