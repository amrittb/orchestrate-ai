Down down you bring me down
I hear you knocking down my
Door and I can't sleep at night
Your face it has no place
No room for you inside my
House I need to be alone

Don't waste your words I don't need
Anything from you
I don't care where you've been or
What you plan to do

Turn turn I wish you'd learn
There's a time and place for everything
I've got to get it through
Cut loose 'cause you're no use
I couldn't stand another
Second in your company

Don't waste your words I don't need
Anything from you
I don't care where you've been or
What you plan to do

Stone me why can't you see
You're a no one nowhere washed up baby
Who'd look better dead
Your tongue is far too long
I don't like the way it sucks and
Slurs upon my every word

Don't waste your words I don't need
Anything from you
I don't care where you've been or
What you plan to do

I am the resurrection and I am the life
I couldn't ever bring myself
To hate you as I'd
Like

I am the resurrection and I am the life
I couldn't ever bring myself
To hate you as I'd
Like
