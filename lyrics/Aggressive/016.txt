I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Stop the things you do
Watch out, I ain't lyin'

Yeah, I can't stand it
You're runnin' around
I can't stand it
No, put me down

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine, oh yeah
Stop the things you do
Watch out, I ain't lyin'

I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you anyhow
And I don't care if you don't want me
I'm yours right now

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
