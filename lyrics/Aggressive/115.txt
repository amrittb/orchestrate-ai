Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised right here in Houston
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere
(Neil!)

A singer in a smokey room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on, come on

Strangers, waiting, up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights, people, living just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night

Working hard to get my fill,
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin anything to roll the dice,
Just one more time
Some will win, some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights, people, oh they're living to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night

Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people

Don't stop believin'
Hold on
Streetlight people

Don't stop believin'
Hold on Houston to your feelin'
Streetlight people

Don't stop
