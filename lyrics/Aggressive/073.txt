One by one they're turning out the lights 
I've been feedin' that ol' jukebox just to hold you tight 
I guess its for the best I just put in my last dime 
I heard you whisper "We'll meet again, another place, another time" 
Chairs are stacked all over tables its closing time they say 
I could wait right here forever if they'd only let me stay 
Anywhere would be much better than lonely room of mine 
Throug a lonely night a waitin' for 
Another place, Another time 
Won't that room of mine be a lonely place to be 
I've been so used to holding you close to me 
Won't that old stairway be hard to climb 
To a lonely room waiting for another place, another time 
Won't that old stairway be hard to climb 
To a lonely room to wait for 
Another Place, Another Time
