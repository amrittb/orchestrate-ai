I'm breakin' rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I needed money 'cause I had none
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I left my baby and I feel so bad
I guess my race is run
But she's the best girl I've ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

Robbin' people with a six-gun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I miss my baby and the good fun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

I left my baby and I feel so bad
I guess my race is run
But she's the best girl I've ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
