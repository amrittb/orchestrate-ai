Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But you were the key to my peace of mind

'Cause you make me feel, 
You make me feel, 
You make me feel like
A natural woman

When my soul was in the lost-and-found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
'Cause if I make you happy I don't need no more

'Cause you make me feel, 
You make me feel, 
You make me feel like
A natural woman

Oh, baby, what you've done to me
You make me feel so good inside
And I just want to be close to you
You make me fell so alive

'Cause you make me feel, 
You make me feel, 
You make me feel like
A natural woman
