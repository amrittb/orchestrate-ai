Fell to the red room
Because she was there
A scarlet woman
She got me in fear

She said do all those things that you do to me
You know what I mean
Do all those things that you do to me yeah

Love remover love remover machine
You little fun remover love remover machine

Baby baby baby baby baby I fell from the sky
Yesterday you blew my mind oh yeah
Having trouble with my direction
Upside down psychotic reaction

Love removal love removal machine
You little soul shaker love removal machine
You little love removal machine
You little fun removal love removal machine

Love removal love removal machine
You little fun remover fun removal machine
You little love removal machine
You little soul shaker love removal machine

Look out here she comes

Shake it don't break it baby
