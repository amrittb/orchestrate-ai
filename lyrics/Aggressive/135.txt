Got those highway blues, can't you hear my motor runnin'
Flyin' down the road with my foot on the floor
All the way in town they can hear me comin'
Ford's about to drop, she won't do no more
And i smell my motor burnin'
Underneath the hood is smoke
Can't stop, and i can't stop
Got to keep on movin' or i'll lose my mind

Oh, rockin' down the highway
Oh, rockin' down the highway
Oh, rockin' down the highway
Oh, rockin' down the highway

The highway patrol got his eyes on me
I know what he's thinkin' and it ain't good
I'm movin' so fast he can barely see me
Gonna lose that man, i know i should
I gotta kick in my pedal
Make my ford move a little bit faster
Can't stop, and i can't stop
Got to keep on movin' or i'll lose my mind

Oh, rockin' down the highway
Oh, rockin' down the highway
Oh, rockin' down the highway
Oh, rockin' down the highway
