You were talking and I thought I heard you say
"Please leave me alone.
Nothing in this world can make me stay.
I'd rather go back, I'd rather go back home."

But if you believed in me like I believe in you,
We could have a love so true, we would go on endlessly.
And I know: anyday, anyday, I will see you smile.
Anyway, anyway, only for a little while.

Well, someday baby, I know you're gonna need me
When this old world has got you down.
I'll be right here, so woman call me
And, I'll never ever let you down.

If you believed in me like I believe in you,
We could have a love so true, we would go on endlessly.
And I know: anyday, anyday, I will see you smile.
Anyway, anyway, only for a little while.

And I know: anyday, anyday, I will see you smile.
Anyway, anyway, only for a little while.

To break the glass and twist the knife into yourself;
You've got to be a fool to understand.
To bring your woman back home after she's left you for another,
You've got to be a, you've got to be a man.

If you believed in me like I believe in you,
We could have a love so true, we would go on endlessly.
And I know: anyday, anyday, I will see you smile.
Anyway, anyway, only for a little while.
