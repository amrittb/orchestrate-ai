How many special people change? 
How many lives are living strange? 
Where were you while we were getting high? 
Slowly walking down the hall 

Faster than a cannonball 
Where were you while we were getting high? 
Someday you will find me 
Caught beneath the landslide 

In a champagne supernova in the sky 
Someday you will find me 
Caught beneath the landslide 
In a champagne supernova 

A champagne supernova in the sky 
Wake up the dawn and ask her why 
A dreamer dreams, she never dies 
Wipe that tear away now from your eye 

Slowly walking down the hall 
Faster than a cannonball 
Where were you while we were getting high? 
Someday you will find me 

Caught beneath the landslide 
In a champagne supernova in the sky 
Someday you will find me 
Caught beneath the landslide 

In a champagne supernova 
A champagne supernova 
'Cause we don't believe 
That they're gonna get away from the summer 

But you and I will never die 
The world's still spinning around we don't know why 
Why-why-why-why-i-i
