Baby gave us away today.
She broke my heart. I can't beg her to stay this time.
I wanna go right out and find a girl.
It's been a long time and I'm seeing the world
Through different eyes, through different eyes.
Oh baby, I ain't begging but I feel like dancing
And would you let a city boy
Hold hands with you? I wanna get to know you.
I never thought of myself as tied down,
But I was so much in love.
It was good that she put me down,
I need someone new, someone who's
Gonna make my heart jump the way she usta do.

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

I think I'm falling in love again.

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

They make me glad I'm a man, I said.

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

I feel so good, that's right!

I take a green eyed girl, she's going to the square,
I'll take a chance, although I ain't going nowhere.
But I wanna go, I wanna go too.
I'll take a northern girl when her parents ain't home
We watching TV and we're all alone
And I wanna know all kindsa girls.
I never thought I'd see the day she'd turn her back on me.
But my baby get's her way today.
I need someone new, someone who's
Gonna make my heart jump the way she usta do.

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

I'm falling in love again.

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

You know I'm glad I'm a man, I said.

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

I feel so good inside

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

baby, I have just the feel alive


All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

I'm falling in love again.

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

I'm glad I'm a man, I said.

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

I feel so good, inside

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

You know I have just the feel alive 

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

I'm falling in love again.

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

I'm glad I'm a man, I said.

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

I feel so good, inside

All kindsa girls, all kindsa girls.

You know I have just the feel alive
