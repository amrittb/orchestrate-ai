We've been here too long tryin' to get along
Pretending that you're oh so shy
I'm a natural man doin' all I can
My temp'rature is runnin' high
Friday night no one in sight and we got so much to share
Talkin's fine if you got the time, I ain't got the time to spare

Do you wanna touch? - Yeah! Do you wanna touch? - Yeah!
Do you wanna touch me there? Yeah!
Do you wanna touch? - Yeah! Do you wanna touch? - Yeah!
Do you wanna touch me there? Where? There! Yeah! Oh!

Yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Mymymymymy!
Yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

Ev'ry growin' boy needs a little joy, all you do is sit an' stare
Beggin' on my knees, baby won't you please
Run your fingers thru' my hair
My my my whisky &amp; Dry, don't it make you feel so fine?
Right or wrong, don't it turn you on
Can't you see we're wastin' time?

Do you wanna touch? - Yeah! Do you wanna touch? - Yeah!
Do you wanna touch me there? Yeah!
Do you wanna touch? - Yeah! Do you wanna touch? - Yeah!
Do you wanna touch me there? Where? There! Yeah! Oh!

Yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! There there there there
Yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Ow
Yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! ....
Every growing boy needs a little joy -
Beggin' on my knees, baby if you please -
Every growing boy needs a little toy -
I'm a natural man doin' all I can -
Every Friday night I got to get it right -
I'm waiting so long oh - ....
