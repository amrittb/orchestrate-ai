You can do anything you choose
Well I'm gonna be the man gonna sing them blues
Red, white and blue down to the bone
You don't like that then take your punk ass home

'Cause I'mma kid rock it up and down your block
With a bottle of scotch and watch lots of crotch
Buy a yacht with a flag sayin chillin the most
(rock that bitch up and down the coast)

You can tell all the critics I'm back from the dead
And fuck Clay Aiken and Radiohead
And if Britney Spears wants a kiss that lasts
Well you can tell her and Madonna they can kiss my ass

And I bet these people never thought they'd see
Little hip-hop, rock and roll, country, soul getting it on at Cobo home in Detroit City

And you know my name and I'm the real mccoy
Name's Kid Rock said I'm the real mccoy
