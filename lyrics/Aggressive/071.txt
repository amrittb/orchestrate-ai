I was born by the river in a little tent 
Oh and just like the river 
I've been running ever since 
It's been a long, a long time coming 
But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will 

It's been too hard living 
but I'm afraid to die 
Cause I don't know 
what's up there beyond the sky 
It's been a long, a long time coming 
But I know a change gonna come, 
oh yes it will 

I go to the movie 
and I go downtown 
somebody keep telling me 
don't hang around 
It's been a long, 
a long time coming 
But I know a change gonna come, 
oh yes it will 

Then I go to my brother 
And I say brother help me please 
But he winds up knockin' me 
Back down on my knees 

Ohhhhhhhhh..... 

There been times that I thought I couldn't last for long 
But now I think I'm able to carry on 
It's been a long, a long time coming 
But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will
