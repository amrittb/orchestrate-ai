There's only one way of life
And that's your own your own your own

My father when I was younger 
Took me up on to the hill 
That looks down on the city smog 
And above the factory spill 
He said now this is where I come 
When I wanted to be free 
but he never was in his lifetime 
But these words stuck with me hey

And so I ran from all of this 
And I climbed that highest hill 
I looked down on to my life 
Above the factory spill 
I looked down onto my life 
As the family disgrace 
Then all my friends on the starting line 
Their wages off to chase 
Yes and all my friends and all their jobs 
All the bloody waste 

CHORUS 

Well well when I grew up, 
learned to love and laugh 
Circled A's on the underpass 
The noise we thought would never stop 
Died a death when the punks grew up 
And we choked on all our dreams 
We resalled all our fears 
Running through the heartless concrete streets 
Chasing our ideas Run
And all the problems of the world 
Won't be solved by this guitar 
And they won't stop coming either 
By the life I've had so far 
And the bright lights of my home town 
Won't be getting any dimmer 
Though their calling has receded 
Like some old distant singer 
And they don't look so appealing 
To the eyes of this poor sinner 

CHORUS
