Well, my pad is very messy and there's whiskers on my chin 
And I'm all hung up on music, and I always play to win 
I ain't got no time for lovin' 'cause my time is all used up 
Just sittin' 'round creatin' all that groovy kind of stuff 

Well, I'm a man, yes I am, and I can't help but love you so 
Well, I'm a man, yes I am, and I can't help but love you so 

Well, if I had my choice of matter I would rather be with cats 
All engrossed in mental chatter showin' where our minds are at, 
And relating to each other just how strong our will can be 
In resisting all involvments with each groovy chick we see 

Well, I'm a man, yes I am, and I can't help but love you so 
Well, I'm a man, yes I am, and I can't help but love you so 

I've got to keep my image while suspended on a throne 
That looks out upon a kingdom filled with people all unknown 
Who imagine I'm not human and my heart is made of stone 
And I've never had no problems and my toliet's trimmed with gold 

Well, I'm a man, yes I am, and I can't help but love you so 
Well, I'm a man, yes I am, and I can't help but love you so
