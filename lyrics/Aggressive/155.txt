Well, I heard the news: there's good rockin' tonight 
I'm gonna hold my baby as tight as I can 
Well, tonight she'll know I'm a mighty, mighty man 
I heard the news: there's good rockin' tonight 

I said, meet me and a-hurry behind the barn 
Don't you be afraid 'cause I'll do you no harm 
I want you to bring along your rockin' shoes 
'Cause tonight we're gonna rock away all our blues 
I heard the news: there's good rockin' tonight 

Well, we're gonna rock 
We're gonna rock 
Let's rock 
Come on and rock 
We're gonna rock all our blues away 

Have you heard the news: everybody's rockin' tonight 
Have you heard the news: everybody's rockin' tonight 
I'm gonna hold my baby as tight as I can 
Well, tonight she'll know I'm a mighty, mighty man 
I heard the news: there's good rockin' tonight 

Well, we're gonna rock, rock, rock, rock 
Come on and rock, rock, rock, rock 
Let's rock, rock, rock, rock 
Well, let's rock, rock, rock, rock 
We're gonna rock all our blues away
