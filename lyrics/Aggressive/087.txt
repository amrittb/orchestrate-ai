I travel over mountains
Down highways
Through the valleys and the bi-ways
Just to find a home in your heart

I'll bring you pretty flowers
Candy moonbeams
Fill your nights with love and sweet dreams
Just to find a home in your heart

We'll make sweet pretty music
While the birdies sing
Tie the love knot with a heart string
Just to find a home in your heart

Baby with you I travel over mountains
Down highways
Through the valleys and the bi-ways
Just to find me a home in your heart
