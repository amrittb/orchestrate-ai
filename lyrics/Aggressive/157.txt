You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will, but what a thrill
Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire!!

I laughed at love 'cause I thought it was funny
You came along and moooooved me honey
I've changed my mind, this love is fine
Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire!!

Kiss me baby, wooo feels good
Hold me baby, wellllll I want to love you like a lover should
Your fine, sooo kind
I want to tell this world that your mine mine mine mine

I chew my nails and and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous, but it sure is fun
C'mon baby, drive my crazy
Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire!!
