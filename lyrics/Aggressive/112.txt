Well I take whatever I want
And Baby I want you
You give me something I need
I wanna tell you,   I got something for you
Come on come on come on and do it
Come on, Babe  and do what you do

I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love

Well its late and I want love
Love is gonna break me in two
Gonna hang me up in the doorway
Gonna hang me up like you do
Come on come on come on and do it
Come on, Babe and do what you do

I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love

Duo-Solo

I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love

I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
