Is it my imagination 
Or have I finally found something worth living for? 
I was looking for some action 
But all I found was cigarettes and alcohol 

You could wait for a lifetime 
To spend your days in the sunshine 
You might as well do the white line 
'Cause when it comes on top . . . 

You gotta make it happen! 
Is it worth the aggravation 
To find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for? 
It's a crazy situation 

But all I need are cigarettes and alcohol! 
You could wait for a lifetime 
To spend your days in the sunshine 
You might as well do the white line 

'Cause when it comes on top... 
You gotta make it happen!
