I don't want to lose you, this good thing
That I got 'cause if I do
I will surely
Surely lose a lot
'Cause her love is better
Than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock, knock on wood, baby

I'm not superstitious about ya
But I can't take no chance
You got me spinnin', baby
Baby, I'm in a trance
'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock, knock on wood, baby

It's no secret
That woman is my loving cup
'Cause she sees to it
That I get enough
Just one touch from her
You know it means so much
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock, knock on wood, baby
I'd better knock, knock, knock

Oh, yeah, think I better knock (Knock, knock) on wood
Think I better knock (Knock, knock) on wood
Think I better knock (Knock, knock) on wood
