Who you tryin' ta mess with ese?
Don't you know I'm loco?

To da one on da flam
Boy it's tough
I just toss that ham in the fryin' pan
Like spam
It's done when I come in
Slam
Damn, I feel like the Son of Sam
Don't make me wrek ya hectic
Automatic got me goin' like Gen'ral Electric
Damn
The lights are blinking I'm thinking
It's all over when I go out drinking
Oh
Makin' my mind slow,
That's why I don't fuck wit da big four-oh
Bro
I got ta' maintain
'cause a nigga like me is goin' insane

[Chorus: x4]
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!

Do my shit undercover
Now it's time for for the blubber
Blabber
To watch dat belly get fatter
Fat boy on a diet
Don't try it
I'll check your ass like a looter in a riot
Much too fast like a sumo slammin' dat ass
Leavin' your face in the grass
You know
I don't take a chulo
Lightly
Bitch just jealous 'cause he can't outwrite me
So kick that style, wicked
Wild
Happy face nigga never seen me smile
Whip dat mainframe
I'll explain
A nigga like me is goin' insane

[Chorus: x4]

Like Louie Armstrong
Play the trumpet, I'll hit dat bong
And break ya off somethin' soon
I got ta get my props
Cops
Come and try ta' snatch my crops
These pigs want to blow my house down
Head underground
To the next town
They get mad when they come to raid my pad
And I'm off in the night blue scad
Yes I'm the pirate
Pilot
Of this ship if I get wit' the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen
Look
But don't make ya' eyes strain
A nigga like me is goin' insane

[Chorus: x4]
