Guess who just got back today
Them wild-eyed boys, that'd been away
Haven't changed, had much to say
But man I still think them cats are great

They were asking if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were living downtown
Driving all the old men crazy

The Boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
(I Said) The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)

You know that chic who used to dance a lot?
Every night she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she got
Man when I tell you she was cool she was red hot
I mean she was steamin'

And that time over at Johnny's place
Well this chic got up and slapped Johnny's face
Man we just fell about the place
What that chic don't wanna know forget 'er

The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
(I said) The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)

Spread the word around
Guess who's back in town
You spread the word around

Friday night they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's bar and grill
The drinks will flow and blood would spill
If the boys wanna fight you better let 'em

That kid rocks down at the corner blasting out my favourite song
The nights are getting warmer and won't be long
Wont be long till the summer comes
Now that the boys are here again

The boys are back in town (the boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town (the boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town (the boys are back in town)
(Spread the word around)
The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
(The boys are back, the boys are back)

The boys are back in town again
They're hanging out at Dino's
The boys are back in town again
