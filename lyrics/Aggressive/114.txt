You let your mind out somewhere down the road.

You got me shaking, got me running away.
You got me crawling up to you ev'ry day.
Don't bring me down.
No, no, no, no, no. Oo, ee, hoo.
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor.
Don't bring me down, down, down,
Down, down, down.
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor.
Don't bring me down.
