Woo, I gave you my money, I gave you my time.
Why you wanna hurt me, girl?
Are you serious? I'm just curious.
Why you wanna hurt me, girl?

Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl?
Just because you're not for real,
Why you wanna hurt me, girl?

Never, ever had a lover who put the pedal to the mettle
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
Oh, no

You took my money, you took my time
Made me think everything was fine
Then you upped and ran away
And made me just go crazy

I never, ever had a lover
Who put the pedal to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
Oh, no, no, no

Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl
Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl

I never, ever had a lover 
Who put the pedal to the metal 
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
Oh, no, no, no

Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl
Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl

You told me to go up the block
And get you a strawberry pop
When I got back to the flat
You had burned rubber out the back

I went to the closet and saw no clothes
All I saw was hangers and poles
I went to the phone and called your mother
And told me you had burned rubber on me, Charlie
OH, no, no (x13)

Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl
Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl

I never, ever had a lover 
Who put the pedal to the metal 
And burned rubber on me, Charlie
OH, no, no, no, no, oh, no, yeah, yeah

Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt, me girl
Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me , girl

Just because your not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl

You took my money, you took my time
Made me think everything was fine
Like the clock on the wall, said ding-ding-dong
Got to find another lover that won't be gone

She won't put the pedal to the metal
And burn rubber, burn rubber, on me, Charlie
NO, no, no, no

I never, ever had a lover
Who put the pedal to the metal 
And burned rubber on me, Charlie
NO, no, no, no, no, no(repeat 8x)
