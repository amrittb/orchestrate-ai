[Spoken:]
How you doin' out there
Y'ever seem to have one of those days
Where it just seems like everybody's gettin' on your case
From your teacher all the way down to your best girlfriend
Well, y'know, I used to have 'em just about all the time
But I found a way to get out of 'em. Let me tell you about it

Sitting in the classroom
Thinking it's a drag
Listening to the teacher rap
Just ain't my bag
The noon bells ring
You know that's my cue
I'm gonna meet the boys
On floor number two!

Smokin' in the boys' room
Smokin' in the boys' room
Now, teacher, don't you fill me up with your rules
But everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school

A-checkin' out the halls
Makin' sure the coast is clear
Lookin' in the stalls
No, there ain't nobody here
Oh, my buddy Fang, and me and Paul
To get caught would surely be the death of us all

Smokin' in the boys' room
Smokin' in the boys' room
Now, teacher, don't you fill me up with your rules
But everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school
All right

Oh, put me to work
In the school book store
Check out counter
And I got bored
Teacher was lookin'
For me all around
Two hours later
You know where I was found

Smokin' in the boys' room (Yes indeed, I was)
Smokin' in the boys' room
Now, teacher, don't you fill me up with your rules
But everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school
One mo'

Smokin' in the boys' room
Oh, smokin' in the boys' room
Now, teacher, I am fully aware of the rules
But everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school
