I still remember it was autumn and the moon was shinin'
My '60 Cadillac was rollin' through Nebraska whinin'
Doin' a hundred twenty, man the fields was bendin' over
Headin' out for the mountains knowin' we was travelin' further
All our fires were blazin' and the spinnin' wheels were turnin' turnin'
Had my girl beside me brother brother she was burnin' burnin'
Up walked a Baptist preachin' southern funky school teacher
She had a line on something heavy but we couldn't reach her
We told her that we needed something that would get us goin'
She put out all she had and laid it on the counter showin'
All I had to do was lay my money down and pick it up
The cops came bustin' in and then we let out in a pickup truck and go

Get out of Denver better go go, get out of Denver better go
Get out of Denver better go go
Get out of Denver cause you look just like a commie
And you might just be a member baby, get out of Denver baby
Get out of Denver
Well the lights were flashin' and the sirens were a screamin' screamin'
We had to pinch each other just to see if we were dreamin'
Made it to Loveland Pass in under less than half an hour
Lord it started drizzlin' and it turned into a thundershower

The rain was drivin' but the Caddy kept on burnin' rubber
We kept on drivin' till we ran through some fog cover
We couldn't see a thing but somehow we just kept on going
We kept on drivin' all night long and then until the mornin'
Fog had finally lifted when we looked to see where we was at
We were starin' at a Colorado state policeman trooper cat and go

Get out of Denver better go go, get out of Denver better go
Get out of Denver better go go
Get out of Denver cause you look just like a commie
And you might just be a member baby, get out of Denver baby
Get out of Denver better go go
