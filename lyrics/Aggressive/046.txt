I've been to Nagasaki Hiroshima too the same I did to them baby I can do to you
Cause I'm a Fujiyama mama and I'm just about to blow my top
Fujiyama-yama Fujiyama
And when I start erupting ain't nobody gonna make me stop

I drink a quart of sakey smoke dynamite
I chase it with tobaccy and then shoot out the light
Cause I'm a Fujiyama mama...
[ guitar ]
Well you can talk about me say that I'm mean
I'll blow your head off baby with nitroglycerine
Cause I'm a Fujiyama mama...

Well you can say I'm crazy stone deaf and dumb
But I can cause destruction just like the atom bomb
Cause I'm a Fujiyama mama...
I drink a quart of sakey...
