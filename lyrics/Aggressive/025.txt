Get outta that bed, wash your face and hands
Get outta that bed, wash your face and hands
Well, you get in that kitchen, make some noise with the pots 'n pans

Way you wear those dresses, the sun comes shinin' through

I can't believe my eyes, all that mess belongs to you

Well, the more I work, the faster my money goes

I said shake, rattle and roll, shake, rattle and roll
Shake, rattle and roll, shake, rattle and roll
Well, you won't do right to save your doggone soul

Shake, rattle and roll, shake, rattle and roll
Well, you won't do right to save your doggone soul

I get over the hill and way down underneath

You make me roll my eyes, even make me grit my teeth

I said shake, rattle and roll, shake, rattle and roll
Shake, rattle and roll, shake, rattle and roll
Well, you won't do nothin' to save your doggone soul

Shake, rattle and roll!
