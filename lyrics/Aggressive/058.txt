I've been on tenterhooks, ending in dirty looks,
list'ning to the Muzak, thinking 'bout this 'n' that.
She said that's that. I don't wanna chitter-chat.
Turn it down a little bit, or turn it down flat.

Pump it up when you don't really need it.
Pump it up until you can feel it.

Down in the pleasure centre, hell bent or heaven sent,
listen to the propaganda, listen to the latest slander.
There's nothing underhand, that she wouldn't understand.

Pump it up until you can feel it.
Pump it up when you don't really need it.

She's been a bad girl. She's like a chemical.
Though you try to stop it, she's like a narcotic.
You wanna torture her. You wanna talk to her.
All the things you bought for her,
putting up your temp'rature.

Pump it up until you can feel it.
Pump it up when you don't really need it.

Out in the fashion show, down in the bargain bin,
you put your passion out, under the pressure pin.
Fall into submission, hit-and-run transmission.
No use wishing now for any other sin.

Pump it up until you can feel it.
Pump it up when you don't really need it
