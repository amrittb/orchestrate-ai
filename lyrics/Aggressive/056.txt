Oooooooh, yeah; ouh, yeah.
Everythin', everythin', everythin's gonna be alright this mornin' 
Ooh yeah, whoaw 
Now when I was a young boy, at the age of five 
My mother said I was, gonna be the greatest man alive 
But now I'm a man, way past 21 
Want you to believe me baby,

I'm a man

That represents man 
No B, O child, Y 
That mean mannish boy

I'm a natural born lovers man 
I'm a man 
I'm a rollin' stone

Sittin' on the outside, just me and my mate 
You know I'm made to move you honey,

The line I shoot will never miss 
When I make love to a woman, 
she can't resist 
I think I go down, 
to old Kansas Stew 
I'm gonna bring back my second cousin, 
that little Johnny Cocheroo 
All you little girls,

I can make love to you woman, 
in five minutes time 
Ain't that a man
