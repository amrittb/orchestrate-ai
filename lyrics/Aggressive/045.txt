Baby, when I think about you
I think about love
Darlin', don't live without you
And your love
If I had those golden dreams
Of my yesterdays
I would wrap you in the heaven
'Til I'm dyin' on the way

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

Baby, if I think about you
I think about love
Darlin', if I live without you
I live without love
If I had the sun and moon
And they were shinin'
I would give you both night and day
Of satisfyin'

Feel like makin'
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you

And if I had those golden dreams
Of my yesterdays
I would wrap you in the heaven
'Til I'm dyin' on the way

Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love
Feel like makin' love to you
