I never had it
I never wanted it
I never had your beauty mark
Nor did I have your black hair
And hazel eyes
My early childhood was not as simple
As yours set in the country
No I did not have a fear of nuns who dressed in black
But I do have your taste
I had no radio show
Nor did I have home-made clothes
Home-made curtains of the same material

I never had it
I never wanted it
I never had your beauty mark

But I do have your taste
And I do have your round face and long hands
I think Callas sang a lovely "norma"
You prefer Robeson in "Deep River"
I may not be so manly
But still I know you love me
Even if I don't have your beauty mark
