Can't you see, she don't want you around no more
Can't you see, that her hand's pointing at the door
Feet don't fail me now
How could anyone stay
Anyone could see it's time to go away
Time to take a powder
Open up your eyes
But it feels like my legs have been paralyzed

Feet don't fail me now
Begging please don't make a fool of me
Feet don't fail me now
Please don't keep me where i should not be
Feet don't fail me now
Stop pretending that you've gone to sleep
Feet don't fail me now
Begging please don't make a fool of me

See your things piled in the hall
Turn around, there's a new picture on the wall
Feet don't fail me now
We're the last ones to know
Anyone could see it's time for us to go
Time to hit the highway
Nothing left to do
But it feels like my shoes have been crazy glued
