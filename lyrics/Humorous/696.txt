Panic on the streets of London 
Panic on the streets of Birmingham 
I wonder to myself 
Could life ever be sane again? 
The leeds side-streets that you slip down 
I wonder to myself 
Hopes may rise on the grasmere 
But honey pie, you're not safe here 
So you run down 
To the safety of the town 
But there's panic on the streets of Carlisle 
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside 
I wonder to myself 

Burn down the disco 
Hang the blessed dj 
Because the music that they constantly play 
It says nothing to me about my life 
Hang the blessed dj 
Because the music they constantly play 

On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down 
Provincial towns you jog 'round 
Hang the dj, hang the dj, hang the dj 
Hang the dj, hang the dj, hang the dj 
Hang the dj, hang the dj, hang the dj 
Hang the dj, hang the dj 
Hang the dj, hang the dj 
Hang the dj, hang the dj, hang the dj 
Hang the dj, hang the dj 
Hang the dj, hang the dj 
Hang the dj, hang the dj, hang the dj 
Hang the dj, hang the dj 
Hang the dj, hang the dj 
Hang the dj, hang the dj, hang the dj 
Hang the dj
