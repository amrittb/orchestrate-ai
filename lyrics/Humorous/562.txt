Tainted Love / Where Did Our Love Go (12" mix) - Soft Cell

Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain that you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love
(whoa-o-o-o) Tainted love

Now I know I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love
(whoa-o-o-o) Tainted love

Don't touch me please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
Now I'm gonna pack my things and go

Tainted love (whoa-o-o-o), tainted love (whoa-o-o-o)
Tainted love (whoa-o-o-o), tainted love (whoa-o-o-o)
Touch me baby, tainted love
Touch me baby, tainted love
Tainted love (whoa-o-o-o)
Tainted love (whoa-o-o-o)
Tainted love
Tainted love

Baby, baby, where did our love go
Oh, don't you leave me, 
Don't you leave me no more
I've got this burnin', yearnin', yearnin' feelin' inside me
Ooohh deep inside me
And it hurts so bad

You came into my life so tenderly
With a burning love
That stings like a bee
And now that I'm surrounded so helplessly
You know I believe, you wanna leave me

Oh, baby, baby, where did our love go
Oh, don't you leave me
Don't you leave me no more
Oh, baby, baby, where did our love go
Oh, don't you leave me
Don't you leave me no more

You came into my life so tenderly
With a burning love
That stings like a bee
And now that I'm surrounded so helplessly
You know I believe, that you wanna leave me

Oh, baby, baby, where did our love go
Oh, baby, baby, don't you leave me no more
I've got this burnin', yearnin', yearnin' feelin' inside me
Oooh deep inside me
And it hurts so bad

Baby, baby, baby, where did our love go
Don't you leave me 
Don't you leave me no more
And now that I'm surrounded so helplessly
You know I believe, you wanna leave me

Oh, baby, baby where did our love go
Where did our love go
Where where where
Now that I'm surrounded oh so helplessly
You know I believe, that you wanna leave me

Baby where did our love go
Where did our love go
Where where where
Baby, baby, where did our love go
Oh don't leave me, don't you wanna leave me
I've got this burnin', yearnin', yearnin' feelin' inside me
Oooooooohh deep inside me
And it hurts so bad

Baby
Baby
