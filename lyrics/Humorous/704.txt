If you got a message
leave your name and number
and we'll get back to you

Sleep on your back,
put ash in your shoes
and always use the old sense of the words.
Your third drink will lead you astray
wandering down the backstreets of the world.

On the last day of your life
don't forget to die,
the things that you do will always make your momma cry
Oh I know you got a lot of hope for
the new men x2.

So you got no friends and you wander through the night,
now you watch the sun rise through a rifle sight.
Well don't believe in people who say it's all been done,
they have time to talk because their race is run.
So get in some licks and hold your head up
& soon you'll be drinking from that crystal cup.

(Repeat chorus)

Good morning to the new world.......
