Punctured bicycle 
On a hillside desolate 
Will nature make a man of me yet? 

When in this charming car 
This charming man 

Why pamper life's complexity 
When the leather runs smooth 
On the passenger seat? 

I would go out tonight 
But I haven't got a stitch to wear 
This man said "it's gruesome 
That someone so handsome should care"

Ah ! A jumped-up pantry boy 
Who never knew his place 
He said "return the ring"
He knows so much about these things 
He knows so much about these things 

I would go out tonight 
But I haven't got a stitch to wear 
This man said "it's gruesome 
That someone so handsome should care"
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man... 
Oh, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man... 

Ah ! A jumped-up pantry boy 
Who never knew his place 
He said "return the ring"
He knows so much about these things 
He knows so much about these things 
He knows so much about these things 

New York version adds :

I would go out tonight 
But I haven't got a stitch to wear 

I would go out tonight 
But I haven't got a stitch to wear 
Oh, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man... 
Oh, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man... 

Ah ! A jumped-up pantry boy 
Who never knew his place 
He said "return the ring"
He knows so much about these things 
He knows so much about these things 
He knows so much about these things
