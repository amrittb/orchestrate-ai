Yeah 
I was working part time in a five-and-dime 
My boss was Mr. McGee 
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind 
Cause I was a bit 2 leisurely 
Seems that I was busy doing something close 2 nothing 
But different than the day before 
That's when I saw her, Ooh, I saw her 
She walked in through the out door, out door 
She wore a 
Raspberry beret 
The kind U find in a second hand store 
Raspberry beret 
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more 
Raspberry beret 
I think I love her 
Built like she was 
She had the nerve 2 ask me 
If I planned 2 do her any harm 
So, look here 
I put her on the back of my bike 
And-a we went riding 
Down by old man Johnson's farm 
I said now, overcast days never turned me on 
But something about the clouds and her mixed 
She wasn't 2 bright 
But I could tell when she kissed me 
She knew how 2 get her kicks 
She wore a 
Raspberry beret 
The kind U find in a second hand store 
Raspberry beret 
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more 
Raspberry beret 
I think I love her 
The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof 
And the horses wonder who U are 
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees 
U feel like a movie star 
Listen 
They say the first time ain't the greatest 
But I tell ya 
If I had the chance 2 do it all again 
I wouldn't change a stroke 
Cause baby I'm the most 
With a girl as fine as she was then 


(Raspberry beret) 
The kind U find (The kind U find) 
The kind U find (In a second hand store) 
Oh no no 
(Raspberry beret) 
(And if it was warm) 
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (She wouldn't wear much more) 
Yeah (Raspberry beret) 
I think I... I think I... I think I love her 
(Raspberry beret) 
No No No 
No No No (The kind U find) 
(In a second hand store) 
(Raspberry beret) 
Tell me 
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (And if it was warm she) 
(Wouldn't wear much more) 
(Raspberry beret) 
I think I love...
