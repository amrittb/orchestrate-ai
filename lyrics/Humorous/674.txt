Do I love you? 
Do I lust for you? 
Am I a sinner 'cause I do the two? 
Could you let me know 
Right now, please 
Bonita Applebum 

[Chorus]
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on [Repeat: x4]

[Q-Tip]
(pause between every verse) 
Hey Bonita, glad to meet ya 
For the kind of stunning newness, I must have foreseen ya 
Hey, being with you is a top priority 
Ain't no need to question the authority 
Chairman of the board, the chief of affections 
You got mine's to swing in your direction 
Hey, you're like a hip hop song, you know? 
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on 

[Chorus] 

38-24-37 (uh, uh, uh!) 
You and me, hun, we're a match made in heaven 
I like to kiss ya where some brothers won't 
I like to tell ya things some brothers don't 
If only you could see through your elaborate eyes 
Only you and me, hun, the love never dies 
Satisfaction, I have the right tactics 
And if you need 'em, I got crazy prophylactics 
So far, I hope you like rap songs 
Bonita Applebum, you gotta put me on 

[Chorus]
