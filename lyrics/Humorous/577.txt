I heard you on the wireless back in Fifty Two
Lying awake intent at tuning in on you.
If I was young it didn't stop you coming through.
Oh-a oh

They took the credit for your second symphony.
Rewritten by machine on new technology,
and now I understand the problems you can see.
Oh-a oh

I met your children
Oh-a oh

What did you tell them?

Video killed the radio star.
Video killed the radio star.

Pictures came and broke your heart.
Oh-a-a-a oh

And now we meet in an abandoned studio.
We hear the playback and it seems so long ago.
And you remember the jingles used to go.
Oh-a oh

You were the first one.
Oh-a oh

You were the last one.

Video killed the radio star.
Video killed the radio star.

In my mind and in my car,
we can't rewind we've gone too far

Oh-a-aho oh,
Oh-a-aho oh

Video killed the radio star.
Video killed the radio star.

In my mind and in my car,
we can't rewind we've gone too far.

Pictures came and broke your heart,
put the blame on VCR.

You are a radio star.
You are a radio star.

Video killed the radio star.
Video killed the radio star.

Video killed the radio star.
Video killed the radio star.

Video killed the radio star.
(You are a radio star.)
