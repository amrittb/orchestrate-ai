Lady in a turban, cocaine tree 
Does a dance so rhythmically 
She's cryin', and a singin' and having a time 
and gee that cocaine tree look fine 
  
You've got to put on your sailin shoes 
Put on your sailing shoes 
Everyone will start to cheer 
When you put on your sailin' shoes 
  
Jedidiah, he's got a dime 
Says he catch a more fish, every time 
Well I've got a line, and you've got a pole 
And I'll meet you at the fishin' hole 
  
You've got to put on your sailin shoes 
Put on your sailing shoes 
Everyone will start to cheer 
When you put on your sailin' shoes 
  
Doctor, doctor, I feel so bad 
This is the worst day, I ever had 
Have you this misery a very long time? 
Well if you if, I'll lay it on the line 
  
You've got to put on your sailin shoes 
Put on your sailing shoes 
Everyone will start to cheer 
When you put on your sailin' shoes
