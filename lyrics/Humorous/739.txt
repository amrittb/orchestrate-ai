I've never known a girl like you before
Now just like in a song from days of yore
Here you come a knockin' knockin' on my door
And I've never met a girl like you before

You gave me just a taste so I want more
Now my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw
'Cause now you've got me crawlin' crawlin' on the floor
And I've never known a girl like you before

You've made me acknowledge the devil in me
I hope to God I'm talkin' metaphorically
Hope that I'm talkin' allegorically
Know that I'm talkin' about the way I feel

And I've never known a girl like you before
Never, never, never, never
Never known a girl like you before

This old town's changed so much
Don't feel like I belong
Too many protest singers
Not enough protest songs

And now you've come along
Yes you've come along
And I've never met a girl like you before
