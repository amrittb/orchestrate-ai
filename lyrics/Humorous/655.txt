The case was pulled from under the bed
She made a call to a sympathetic friend and made arrangements
The door was closed, there was a note
I couldn't be bothered, maybe I'll choke, no more engagements
With where-have-you-beens and far away frowns
Trying to be good by not being 'round

And here in the bar, the piano man's found
Another nail for my heart
And here in the bar, the piano man's found
Another nail for my heart

That stupid old bug that kills only love
I want to be good, is that not enough

So play me the song that makes it so tough
Another nail for my heart
Then play me the song that makes it so tough
Another nail for my heart

I had excuses, those little boy lies
That she computed by watching my eyes and told me firmly
She couldn't stand it, I'm bad on her heart
She dropped her make-up and I found the bar, now it concerns me
I've had a bad time, now love is resigned
I've been such a fool, I've loved and goodbyed

So here in the bar, the piano man's found
Another nail for my heart
And here in the bar, the piano man's found
Another nail for my heart
And here in the bar, the piano man's found
Another nail for my heart
And here in the bar, the piano man's found
Another nail for my heart
And here in the bar, the piano man's found
Another nail for my heart
