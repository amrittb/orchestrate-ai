I was a stranger
When i came to town
Just yesterday 
I was a stranger
They dont come much stranger

So why
Why did you believe
All every word I said
Why did you believe
Believe a stranger
A stranger

And why do you women in this town
Let me look at you so bold
When you have seen what i was
In the last town
In the last town
You should have seen what i was
If i was a stranger
I was worse than a stranger
I was well-known
