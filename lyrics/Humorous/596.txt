My dinner's on fire while she watches TV 
And if you've ever wondered what it's like to be me 
She takes all my money and leaves me no smokes 
Yells at my buddies and insults my folks 
I'm breakin' my back doin' the best that I can 
She's got time for the dog and none for her man 
And I'm no dope, but I can't cope 
So hit the fuckin' road and piss up a rope 

You can piss up a rope 
And you can put on your shoes, hit the road get truckin' 
Pack your bag, I don't need the ag 
On your knees you big, booty bitch start suckin' 
You ride my ass like a horse in a saddle 
Now you're up shits creek with a turd for a paddle 
And I can't cope -- piss up a rope 

Uh, you can piss up a rope and feel the pissy dribble 
You can piss up a rope and watch me giggle 
For the last 6 months I been packin' your bag 
You can wash my balls with a warm, wet rag 
Till my balls feel smooth and soft like silk 
I'm sick of your mouth and your 2 percent milk 
And I'm no dope, but I've lost all hope 
So hit the fuckin' road and piss up a rope 

You can piss up a rope 
And you can put on your shoes, hit the road get truckin' 
Pack your bag, I don't need the ag 
On your knees you big, booty bitch start suckin' 
You ride my ass like a horse in a saddle 
Now you're up shits creek with a turd for a paddle 
And I can't cope -- piss up a rope
