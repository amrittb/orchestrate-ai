She keeps Moet and Chandon in her pretty cabinet
'Let them eat cake' she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy 
And anytime an invitation you can decline 
Caviar and cigarettes well versed in etiquette
Extr'ordinarily nice 

She's a killer queen gunpowder gelatine, dynamite with a lazer beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind... (anytime) 
Recommended at the price Insatiable an appetite (wanna try?)

To avoid complications, she never kept the same address 
In conversation, she spoke just like a baroness 
Met a man from China went down to Geisha Minah 
Then again incidentally if you're that way inclined 
Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally) 
For cars she couldn't care less, fastidious and precise

She's a killer queen gunpowder gelatine 
Dynamite with a lazer beam, guaranteed to blow your mind (anytime)
Recommended at the price, Insatiable an appetite (wanna try?)

Drop of a hat she's as willing as a playful as a pussy cat 
Then momentarily out of action, temporarily out of gas 
To absolutely drive you wild, wild 
She's out to get you
She's a killer queen gunpowder gelatine
dynamite with a lazer beam, guaranteed to blow your mind (anytime)
Recommended at the price, insatiable an appetite (wanna try?)
