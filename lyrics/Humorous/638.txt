Sometimes I step into timeless zone,
And I lose my way.
I don't know where I am.
Sometimes I feel like I'm in the Milky Way.
And I lose myself.
I don't know who I am .
I discover whiskers of a cat in a timeless zone.
And I put them on my face.
In a moment I become a sweet little cat.
And I dance on a flying saucer. 

I am a cat. 

I discover ears of a cat in the Milky Way.
And I put them on my head.
In a moment I become a sweet little cat.
And I dance on a flying saucer .

I am a cat.
