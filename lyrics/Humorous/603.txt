I went home with the waitress
The way I always do
How was I to know
She was with the
Russians, too?

I was gambling in Havana
I took a little risk
Send lawyers, guns and money
Dad, get me out of this hyeah

I'm the innocent bystander
Somehow I got stuck
Between the rock
and a hard place
And I'm down on my luck
Yes I'm down on my luck
Well I'm down on my luck

I'm hiding in Honduras
I'm a desperate man
Send lawyers, guns and money
The shit has hit the fan

All right
Send lawyers, guns and money 
Huh!
Uh...
Send lawyers, guns and money 
Uhh!
Send lawyers, guns and money
Hyah!
Send lawyers, guns and money 
Ooh!
Yeah!
Yeah
Yeah...
Uh!
