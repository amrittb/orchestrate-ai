Blackberry way absolutely pouring down with rain,
It's a terrible day.
Up with the lark, silly girl I don't know what to say,
She was running away.
But now I'm standing on the corner,
Lost in the things that I said.
What am I supposed to do now?

Goodbye blackberry way
I can't see you, I don't need you.
Goodbye blackberry way
Sure to want me back another day.

Flowers in the park overgrowing but the trees are bare
There's a memory there.
Boats on the lake, unattended now for all to drown
I'm incredibly down.
Just like myself they are neglected,
Turn with my eyes to the wall
What am I supposed to do now?

Goodbye blackberry way

I can't see you, I don't need you.
Goodbye blackberry way
Sure to want me back another day.

Run for the train, look behind you for she may be there
Said a thing in the air
Blackberry way, see the battlefield of careless sins
Cast to the winds
So full of emptiness without her,
Lost in the words that I said.
What am I supposed to do now?

Goodbye blackberry way
I can't see you, I don't need you.
Goodbye blackberry way
Sure to want me back another day.

Goodbye blackberry way
I can't see you, I don't need you.
Goodbye blackberry way
Sure to want me back another day.
