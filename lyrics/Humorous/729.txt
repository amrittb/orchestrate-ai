Well I'm goin' out 
I'm goin' out lookin' for a cynical girl 
Who's got no use for the real world 
I'm lookin' for a cynical girl 
Well I hate TV 

There's gotta be somebody other than me 
Who's ready to write it off immediately 
I'm lookin' for a cynical girl 

Well I'll know right away by the look in her eye 
She harbors no illusions and she's worldly-wise 
And I'll know when I give her a listen that she 
She's what I've been missin' 
What I've been missin' 
I'll be lost in love 

And havin' some fun with my cynical girl 
Who'll have no use for the real world 
I'm lookin' for a cynical girl 
Well I'm goin' out 

I'm goin' out lookin' for a cynical girl 
Who's got no use for the real world 
I'm lookin' for a cynical girl 

Yeah I'll know right away by the look in her eye 
She harbors no illusions and she's worldly-wise 
And I'll know when I give her a listen that she 
She's what I've been missin' 
What I've been missin' 
I'll be lost in love 

And havin' some fun with my cynical girl 
Who'll have no use for the real world 
I'm lookin' for a cynical girl
