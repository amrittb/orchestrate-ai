HER: They say we're young and we don't know
      We won't find out until we grow
 HIM: Well I don't know if all that's true
      'Cause you got me, and baby I got you

 HIM: Babe
BOTH: I got you babe
      I got you babe

 HER: They say our love won't pay the rent
      Before it's earned, our money's all been spent
 HIM: I guess that's so, we don't have a pot
      But at least I'm sure of all the things we got

 HIM: Babe
BOTH: I got you babe
      I got you babe

 HIM: I got flowers in the spring
      I got you to wear my ring
 HER: And when I'm sad, you're a clown
      And if I get scared, you're always around

 HER: Don't let them say your hair's too long
      'Cause I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
 HIM: Then put your little hand in mine
      There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

 HIM: Babe
BOTH: I got you babe
      I got you babe

 HIM: I got you to hold my hand
 HER: I got you to understand
 HIM: I got you to walk with me
 HER: I got you to talk with me
      I got you to kiss goodnight
      I got you to hold me tight
      I got you, I won't let go
      I got you to love me so

BOTH: I got you babe
      I got you babe
      I got you babe
      I got you babe
      I got you babe
