Do you remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars?
I don't know if you knew that
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards
Henri Winterman Cigars
Though she never told me her name
I still love you, Girl From Mars

Sitting in our dreamy daze by the water's edge
On a cool summer night
Fireflies and the stars in the sky
Gentle glowing light
From your cigarette
The breeze blowing softly on my face
Reminds me of something else
Something that in my memory has been misplaced
Suddenly all comes back
And as I look to the stars

I remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars
I don't know if you knew that
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards
Henri Winterman Cigars
Though she never told me her name
I still love you, Girl From Mars

Surging through the darkness over the moonlight strand
Electricity in the air
Twisting all through the night on the terrace
Now that summer's here

I know that you are almost in love with me
I can see it in your eyes
Strange light shimmering over the sea tonight
And it almost blows my mind
And as I look to the stars

I remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars
I don't know if you knew that
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards
Henri Winterman Cigars
Though she never told me her name
I still love you, Girl From Mars

Today I sleep in the chair by the window
It felt as if you'd returned
I thought that you were standing over me
When I woke there was no-one there
I still love you, Girl From...
MARS!

Do you remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars?
I don't know if you knew that
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards
Henri Winterman Cigars
Though she never told me her name

Do you remember the time I knew a Girl From Mars?
I don't know if you knew that
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards
Henri Winterman Cigars
And I still dream of you
I still love you, Girl From Mars
