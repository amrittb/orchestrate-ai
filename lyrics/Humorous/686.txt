Well, Annie's pretty neat, she always eats her meat
Joe is awful strong, bet your life he's putting us on
Oh lordy, oh lordy, you know I need some loving
Oh move me, touch me

[Chorus]
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on, but I'm only dancing
She turns me on, don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing

Oh shadow love was quick and clean, life's a well-thumbed machine
I saw you watching from the stairs, you're everyone that ever cared
Oh lordy, oh lordy, you know I need some loving
Move me, touch me

[Chorusx2]

Dancing
Won't someone dance with me?
Touch me, ohhh!
