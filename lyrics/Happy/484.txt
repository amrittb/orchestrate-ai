Come down off your throne and leave your body alone.
Somebody must change.
You are the reason Ive been waiting so long.
Somebody holds the key.

But Im near the end and I just aint got the time
And Im wasted and I cant find my way home.

Come down on your own and leave your body alone.
Somebody must change.
You are the reason Ive been waiting all these years.
Somebody holds the key.

Chorus

But I cant find my way home.
But I cant find my way home.
But I cant find my way home.
But I cant find my way home.
Still I cant find my way home,
And I aint done nothing wrong,
But I cant find my way home.
