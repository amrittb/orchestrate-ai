(Verse 1)
I keep on fallin'... in--- love with you
Sometimes I love ya, sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good, At times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin', makes me so confused

[Chorus]
I keep on fallin', in and out of love with you
I never loved someone the way that i'm lovin' you

(Verse 2)
Oh Oh, I.... never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure,
cause me so much pain,
'Cause when I
think I'm taking
more than would a fool I start
fallin' back in love with you.

(Chorus)
I keep on fallin', in and out of love witha you
I never loved someone the way that i'm lovin' you

(Bridge)Oh baby
I,I,I,I'm
Fa-a-allin'
I,I,I,I'm
Fa-a-allin'
Fall,fall,fa-a-a-allin'x2

O-o-o-o-oh

(Chorus)
I keep on fallin', in and out of love witha you
I never loved someone the way that i'm lovin' you

I'm fallin', in and out of love witha you
I never loved someone the way that i'm lovin' you

I'm fallin', in and out of love witha you
I never loved someone the way that i'm lovin' you

what.
