I'll fake it through the day
with some help from johnny walker red
and the cold pain behind my eyes
that shoots back through my head
with two tickets torn in half
and a lot of nothing to do
but it's alright cause some enchanted night, i'll be with you
tarot cards and the lines in my hand
tell me i'm wrong but then untrue
got plans for both of us
that involved a trip out of town
to a place i've seen in a magazine
that you left lying around
i can't hold my liquor but
i keep a good attitude
cause it's alright some enchanted night, i'll be with you
and though you'd rather see me gone
than to see this come the day
i'll be waiting for you anyway
next door the tv's flashing
blue frames on the wall
it's a comedy from the 70's
when the lead no one recalls
vanished into oblivion
it's easy to do
and i cry to sleep when you talked to me
the day you said we were through
but it's alright some enchanted night, ill be with you
