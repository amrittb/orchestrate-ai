I don't care how long this lasts
We have no future - we have no past
I write this now while I'm in control
I'll choose the words and how the melody goes -

Along winding streets, we walked hand in hand
And how I long for that sharp wind
To take my breath away again
I'd run my fingers through your hair
Hair like a wheat field, I'd run through
That I'd run through 

And I miss you so I miss you so
No you're gone, I feel so alone
I miss you so

I'd send you a flower a sunflower bright
While you cloud my days, messing up my nights

And all the way up to the top of your head
Sunshower kisses, I felt we had

And I miss you so I miss you so
All I gotta do, is think of you and I miss you so

Baby I'm afraid to say why I miss you so
