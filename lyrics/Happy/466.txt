I pulled into Nazareth, was feeling 'bout half past dead 
I just need some place where I can lay my head 
Hey, mister, can you tell me, where a man might find a bed? 
He just grinned and shook my hand, "No" was all he said. 

[Chorus]
Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free 
Take a load off Fanny, and you put the load right on me 

I picked up my bags, I went looking for a place to hide 
When I saw old Carmen and the Devil, walking side by side 
I said, "Hey, Carmen, c'mon, let's go downtown" 
She said, "I gotta go, but my friend can stick around" 

[Chorus]

Go down, Miss Moses, ain't nothin' you can say 
It's just old Luke, and Luke's waiting on the judgment day 
Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Annalee 
He said, "Do me a favor, son, won't you stay and keep Annalee company" 

[Chorus]

Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog 
Said, "I will fix your rag, if you'll take Jack, my dog" 
I said, "Wait a minute Chester, you know, I'm a peaceful man" 
He said, "That's OK, boy, won't you feed him when you can" 

[Chorus]

Catch the cannonball, now to take me down the line 
My bag is sinking low, and I do believe it's time 
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one 
Who sent me here, with her regards for everyone 

[Chorus]
