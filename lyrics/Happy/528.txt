I am an old woman
Named after my mother
My old man's another
Child that's grown old
If dreams were lightnin'
And Thunder were desire
This old house would've burned down
A long time ago

Make me an angel
That flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster
Of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing 
That I can hold onto
To believe in this livin'
Is such a hard way to go

When I was a young girl
I had me a cowboy
Weren't much to look at
Just a free ramblin' man
But that was a long time
And no matter how I try
The years just flow by
Like a broken down dam

Make me an angel
That flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster
Of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing 
That I can hold onto
To believe in this livin'
Is such a hard way to go

There's flies in the kitchen
I can hear 'em in there buzzin'
And I ain't done nothin'
Since I woke up today
How the hell can a person
Go to work in the mornin'
And come home in the evenin'
And have nothin' to say

Make me an angel
That flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster
Of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing 
That I can hold onto
To believe in this livin'
Is such a hard way to go
