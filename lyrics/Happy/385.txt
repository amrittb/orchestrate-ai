Rows and flows of angel hair 
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere, 
I've looked at clouds that way.

But now they only block the sun, 
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done, 
But clouds got in my way.

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels, 
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real, 
I've looked at love that way. 

But now it's just another show, 
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know, 
Don't give yourself away. 

I've looked at love from both sides now 
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud, 
To say "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds, 
I've looked at life that way.

Oh but now old friends they're acting strange, 
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained 
In living every day.

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all

I've looked at life from both sides now 
From up and down, and still somehow 
It's life's illusions I recall 
I really don't know life at all
