Wheels turning around
Into alien grounds
Pass through different times
Leave them all Behind

Just to see
We've got so far to go
Until we get there
Just let it flow

Colours shining clear
Fading into night
Our grasp is broken
There's nothing we can do

I Don't care about the colours
I don't care about the light
I don't care about the truth
