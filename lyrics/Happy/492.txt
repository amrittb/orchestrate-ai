And when I see the sign that
points one way
The lot we used to pass by
every day

(Chorus):
Just walk away Renee, 
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my
block are not the same
You're not to blame

From deep inside the tears that
I'm forced to cry
From deep inside the pain I
I chose to hide

(Chorus)
Now as the rain beats down
upon my weary eyes
For me it cries

(Solo)

(Chorus)

Your name and mine inside 
a heart upon a wall
Still finds a way to haunt me,
though they're so small

(Chorus)
