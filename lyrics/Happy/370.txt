        Yeah, said it's all right
        I won't forget
        All the times I've waited patiently for you
        And you'll do just what you choose to do
        And I will be alone again tonight my dear


   Yeah, I heard a funny thing
        Somebody said to me
        You know that I could be in love with almost everyone
        I think that people are
        The greatest fun
        And I will be alone again tonight my dear
