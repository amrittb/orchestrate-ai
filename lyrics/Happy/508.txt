Hello it's me,
I've thought about us for a long, long time,
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong,
There's something here that doesn't last too long,
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine.
 
Seeing you, or seeing anything as much as I do,
I take for granted that you're always there,
I take for granted that you just don't care,
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through.
 
It's important to me 
That you know you are free,
'Cause I never want to make you change for me.
Think of me,
You know that I'd be with you if I could
I'll come around to see you once in a while
or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should.

Sometimes I thought it wasn't so bad.
