Ever seen a blind man cross the road
Trying to make the other side?
Ever seen a young girl growing old
Trying to make herself a bride?

So what becomes of you my love
When they have finally stripped you of
The handbags and the gladrags
That your grandad had to sweat so you could buy.
Baby

Once I was a young man
And all I thought I had to do was smile.
You are still a young girl,
And you bought everything in style.
Listen
But once you think you're in you're out
'Cause you dont mean a single thing without
The handbags and the gladrags
That your grandad had to sweat so you could buy.

Sing a song of six-pence for your sake
And take a bottle full of rye.
Four and twenty blackbirds in a cake,
And bake them all in a pie.

They told me you missed school today,
So what I suggest: you just throw them all away,
The handbags and the gladrags
That your poor old granddad had to sweat to buy.

They told me you missed school today,
So I suggest you just throw them all away,
The handbags and the gladrags
That your poor old granddad had to sweat to buy ya.
