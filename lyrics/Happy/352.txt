HERE
(written by S. Malkmus/S. Kannberg of Pavement;
the lyrics, as sung by Stuart, vary slightly from the original, printed lyrics)

I was dressed for success
But success, it never comes
And I'm the only one who laughs
At your jokes when they are so bad
And you're jokes are always bad
But they're not as bad as this
Chorus:

Come join us in a prayer 
We'll be waiting, waiting where 
Everything's ending here 
And all the sterile striking it
Defends an empty dock you cast away
And rain upon your forehead
Where the mist's for hire
If it's just too clear
Let's spend our last
1/4 stance randomly
Go down to the outlet once again
Painted portrait of minions and slaves
Crotch mavens and one night plays
Are they the only ones who laugh?
At the jokes when they are so bad
And the jokes are always bad
But they're not as bad as this

(chorus)

And all the Spanish candles unsold
Have gone away to this
And a "run-on piece of mount on"
Trembles, shivers runs down the freeway
I guess she spent her last quarter randomly
I guess a guess is the best I'll do
