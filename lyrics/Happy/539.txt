I walk along the city streets you used to walk along with me
And every step I take recalls how much in love we used to be

Oh how can I forget you go
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

I was born to love you 
And I will never be free 
You'll always be a part of me 
Whoa-ooo-ohhh-oh

When shadows fall I pass a small cafe where we would dance at night
And I can't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight

Oh how can I forget you go
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me 

I was born to love you 
And I will never be free 
You'll always be a part of me 
Whoa-ooo-ohhh-oh 
Whoa-oh-ooo-ohhh 

If you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share 
Just come back to the places where we used to go 
And I'll be there 

Oh how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me 

I was born to love you 
And I will never be free 

When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me 
Always something there to remind me 
Always something there to remind me
