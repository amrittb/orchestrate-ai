I think I'm goin' mad and it's makin' me sad, 
It's a yearnin' for my old back door.
I realize maybe I was born to lead, better swallow my silly country pride.
 
Goin' home, running' home, down the Gasoline Alley where I started from.
Goin' home, and I'm running' home, down the Gasoline Alley where I was born.
 
When the weather's better and rails unfreeze, 
And the wind won't whistle 'round my knees,
I'll put on my weather suit and catch you in the rain.
I'll be home before the milk's upon the door.
 
Goin' home, running' home, down the Gasoline Alley where I started from.
Goin' home, and I'm running' home, down the Gasoline Alley where I was born.
 
But if anything should happen and my plans go wrong,
Should I stray to the house on the hill,
Let it be known that my intentions were good,
I'd be singing in my alley if I could 
 
And if I'm goin' away and it's my turn to go,'
Should the blood run cold in my veins,
Just one favor I'd be askin' of you,
Don't bury me here it's too cold.
 
Take me back carry me back down to Gasoline Alley where I started from.
Take me back, won't cha carry me home down to 
Gasoline Alley where I started from.
 
Take me back carry me back down to gasoline Alley where I started from.
Take me back, won't cha carry me home down to
