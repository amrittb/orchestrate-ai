Ladies and gentlemen we are floating in space

All I want in life is 
a little bit of love
To take the pain away
Getting strong today
A giant step each day
All I want in life's
A little bit of love to take the pain away
Getting strong today
A giant step each day

I've been told
Only fools rush in
Only fools rush in
But I don't believe
I don't believe
I could still fall in love with you

I will love you 'til I die
And I will love you all the time
So please put your sweet hand in mine
And float in space
And drift in time
All my time until I die
We'll float in space just you and I

I will love you 'til I die
And I will love you all the time
So please put your sweet hand in mine
And float in space
And drift in time
All my time until I die
We'll float in space just you and I

I think I'll love you today
I guess that's what you get
And I don't know where we are all going to

Life don't get stranger than this
But it is what it is
And I don't know where we are all going to

I will love you 'til I die
And I will love you all the time
So please put your sweet hand in mine
And float in space
And drift in time
All my time until I die
We'll float in space just you and I

Everything happens today
And we're out here to stay
And I don't know where we are all going to

I think I'll love you today
I guess that's what you get
And I don't know where we are all going to
