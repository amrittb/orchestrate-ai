Somewhere deep inside
Something's got a hold on you
And it's pushing me aside
See it stretch on forever
CHORUS
I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon
VERSE
Stripping back the coats
Of lies and deception
Back to nothingness
Like a week in the desert
CHORUS
BRIDGE
So don't say no
Don't say nothing's wrong
Cos when you get back home
Maybe I'll be gone
VERSE
It would cause me pain
If we were to end it
But I could start again
You can depend on it
CHORUS
I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon
