They pulled her from a ditch last night
somewhere down on 95
on the wrong side of the road
Found a needle and a pipe
she had hidden by her side
because it must have been so
difficult to deal
I used to know the face
Broken on the steering wheel

It's kinda hard I must confess
I was pissed and she was right
but it don't make her no saint
In the resting comic book it showed how it might have looked
if she ever found the ability to feel

I used to know the face
Broken on the steering wheel

It's so far away please tell her from my heart
It's so far away please tell her from my home

It's so far away please tell her from my heart
It's so far away please tell her from my home
