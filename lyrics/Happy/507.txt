In the twilight glow I see
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again

Love is like a dying ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Now my hair has turned to silver 
All my life I've loved in vain 
I can see her star in heaven 
Blue eyes crying in the rain
