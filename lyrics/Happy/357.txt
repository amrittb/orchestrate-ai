Little hands clapping
Children are laughing
Little hands clapping all over the world

Piper is piping
Drummers are drumming
Little hands clapping all over the world

Little hands clapping
Children are sharing
Little loves loving, all little boys and girls

Children are singing
The truths that they're bringing
Freedom is ringing all 'round the world

Come let us meet them
Ah, yes, we will greet them

Little hands clapping
Children are caring
Piper is calling all over the world

Out in the street
The sick that you meet
How many friends do you call your own?

Come let us meet them
Yes, we will greet them

Children are clapping
Children are caring
Children are shattering records and rules

Little hands caring
Little hands sharing
The old ones and the gold ones and the family jewels

Come let us meet them
Yes, we will greet them

Little hands clapping
Children are happy
Little hands loving all 'round the world

Little hands clasping
Truth they are grasping
A world with no pain for one and all

And they are learning
Their souls, they are yearning
A nice place to play and no place to fall

Come let us meet them
Ah, yes, we will greet them
