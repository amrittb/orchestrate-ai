Father along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine 
We'll understand it all by and by

When we see Jesus coming in glory
When he comes from his home in the sky
Then we shall meet him in that bright mansion
We'll understand it all by and by
