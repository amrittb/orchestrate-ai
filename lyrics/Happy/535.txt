Childhood living is easy to do 
The things you wanted I bought them for you 
Graceless lady you know who I am 
You know I can't let you slide thru my hands 
Wild horses couldn't drag me away 
Wild wild horses couldn't drag me away 
I watched you suffer a dull aching pain 
Now you've decided to show me the same 
No sweeping exits or off stage lights
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind 
Wild horses couldn't drag me away 
Wild wild horses couldn't drag me away 

Solo

I know I've dreamed you a sin and a lie 
I had my freedom but I don't have much time 
Faith has been broken tears must be cried 
Let's do some living after we die
Wild horses couldn't drag me away 
Wild wild horses we'll ride them some day

SOLO

Wild horses couldn't drag me away 
Wild wild horses we'll ride them some day
