Dirty old river, must you keep rolling, rolling into the night 
People so busy, make me feel dizzy, taxi light shines so bright 
But I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze on Waterloo Sunset, I am in paradise 
Every day I look at the world from my window
Chilly chilliest evening time, Waterloo sunset's fine

Terry meets Julie, Waterloo Station, every Friday night 
But I am so lazy, don't want to wander, I stay at home at night 
But I don't feel afraid
As long as I gaze on Waterloo Sunset, I am in paradise 
Every day I look at the world from my window
Chilly chilliest evening time,  Waterloo sunset's fine.

Millions of people swarming like flies 'round Waterloo underground 
Terry and Julie cross over the river where they be safe and sound 
And they don't need no friends
As long as they gaze on Waterloo Sunset, they are in paradise
