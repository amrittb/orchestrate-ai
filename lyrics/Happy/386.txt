I'm in the dark, I'd like to read his mind 
but I'm frightened of the things I might find 
Oh, there must be something he's thinking of 
to tear him away 
when I tell him that I'm falling in love 
why does he say 

hush hush 
keep it down now 
voices carry 

I try so hard not to get upset 
because I know all the trouble I'll get 
oh, he tells me tears are something to hide 
and something to fear 
and I try so hard to keep it inside 
so no one can hear 

hush hush 
keep it down now 
voices carry 
He wants me 
but only part of the time 
He wants me 
if he can keep me in line 

hush hush 
keep it down now 
voices carry 
hush hush, darling, she might overhear 
oh, no-voices carry 
he said shut up he said shut up 
oh God can't you keep it down 
voices carry 
I wish he would let me talk
