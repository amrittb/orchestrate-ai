There you stood on the edge of your feather, 
     Expecting to fly. 
     While I laughed, I wondered whether 
     I could wave goodbye, 
     Knowin' that you'd gone. 
     By the summer it was healing, 
     We had said goodbye. 
     All the years we'd spent with feeling 
     Ended with a cry, 
     Babe, ended with a cry, 
     Babe, ended with a cry. 
      
     I tried so hard to stand 
     As I stumbled and fell to the ground. 
     So hard to laugh as I fumbled 
     And reached for the love I found, 
     Knowin' it was gone. 
     If I never lived without you, 
     Now you know I'd die. 
     If I never said I loved you, 
     Now you know I'd try, 
     Babe, now you know I'd try. 
     Babe, now you know I'd try, 
     Babe.
