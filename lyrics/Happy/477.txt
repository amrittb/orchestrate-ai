I don't know just where I'm going
But I'm gonna try for the kingdom, if I can 
'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
When I put a spike into my vein
And I'll tell ya, things aren't quite the same 
When I'm rushing on my run
And I feel just like Jesus' son
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I have made the big decision
I'm gonna try to nullify my life
'Cause when the blood begins to flow
When it shoots up the dropper's neck
When I'm closing in on death
And you can't help me now, you guys
And all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk 
You can all go take a walk
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I wish that I was born a thousand years ago 
I wish that I'd sail the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Going from this land here to that
In a sailor's suit and cap
Away from the big city
Where a man can not be free
Of all of the evils of this town
And of himself, and those around
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know 
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know

Heroin, be the death of me
Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life 
Because a mainer to my vein
Leads to a center in my head
And then I'm better off and dead 
Because when the smack begins to flow 
I really don't care anymore
About all the Jim-Jim's in this town 
And all the politicians makin' busy sounds 
And everybody puttin' everybody else down 
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds
'Cause when the smack begins to flow
Then I really don't care anymore
Ah, when the heroin is in my blood
And that blood is in my head
Then thank God that I'm as good as dead 
Then thank your God that I'm not aware 
And thank God that I just don't care
And I guess I just don't know
And I guess I just don't know
