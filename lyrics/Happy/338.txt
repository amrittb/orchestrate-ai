When are you gonna come down
When are you going to land 
Should I stayed on the farm 
I Should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy is too young to be singing the blues

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse 
I'm going back to my plow
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horney black toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do then
Maybe they'll shoot down the plane or
Take you a couple of vodkas and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you will get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny 
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

So goodbye yellow brick road 
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plow
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horney black toad
Oh I finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road
