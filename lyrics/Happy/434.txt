I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour 
But heaven knows I'm miserable now 

I was looking for a job, and then I found a job 
And heaven knows I'm miserable now 

In my life 
Why do I give valuable time 
To people who don't care if I live or die? 

Two lovers entwined pass me by 
And heaven knows I'm miserable now 

I was looking for a job, and then I found a job 
And heaven knows I'm miserable now 

In my life 
Oh, why do I give valuable time 
To people who don't care if I live or die? 

What she asked of me at the end of the day 
Caligula would have blushed 

"You've been in the house too long" she said
And I (naturally) fled 

In my life 
Why do I smile 
At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye?
