They call it stormy Monday
But Tuesday's just as bad

Wednesday's worse, Lord
And Thursday's, oh, so sad

The eagle flies on Friday
And Saturday, I go out to play
Yes, the eagle flies on Friday
And Saturday, I go out to play

Sunday, I go to church
And I kneel down and pray
And this is what I say, baby

Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me
You know I cried
Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me

You know I'm trying
Trying to find my baby
Won't somebody please
Send her home to me, yeah

Well, I cried
Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me
I said I cried
Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me

You know I'm trying
Trying to find my baby
Send her home to me
Whoa, yeah
