You look to me
Like misty rose
Too soft to touch
But too lovely to leave alone.

If I could be
Like misty roses
I'd love you much 
You're too lovely to leave alone.

Flowers often cry
But too late to find
That their beauty has been lost
With their peace of mind.

You look to me
Like love forever
Too good to last 
But too lovely not to try.

If I believed
In love forever
I'd forget the past
You're just too lovely not to try.
