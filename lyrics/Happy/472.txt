He was sitting in the lounge of the Empire Hotel
He was drinking for diversion 
He was thinking for himself 
A little money riding on the Maple Leafs 
Along comes a lady in lacy sleeves
She says let me sit down
You know, drinkin' alone's a shame
It's a shame it's a crying shame
Look at those jokers 
Glued to that damn hockey game 
Hey honey-you've got lots of cash 
Bring us round a bottle 
And we'll have some laughs 
Gin's what I'm drinking 
I was raised on robbery

I'm a pretty good cook 
I'm sitting on my groceries 
Come up to my kitchen
I'll show you my best recipe 
I try and I try but I can't save a cent
I'm up after midnight cooking
Trying to make my rent
I'm rough but I'm pleasin' 
I was raised on robbery

We had a little money once
They were pushing through a four lane highway
Government gave us three thousand dollars
You should have seen it fly away 
First he bought a '57 Biscayne 
He put it in the ditch
He drunk up all the rest
That son of a bitch 
His blood's bad whiskey 
I was raised on robbery 

You know you ain't bad looking
I like the way you hold your drinks
Come home with me honey
I ain't asking for no full length mink
Hey, where you going
Don't go yet
Your glass ain't empty and we just met
You're mean when your loaded
I was raised on robbery
