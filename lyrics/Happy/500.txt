Ev'rything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said "Yes;"
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,)When it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle;
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I mary sweet Lorraine.
