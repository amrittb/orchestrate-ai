I'm not alone cause the TV's on yeah.
I'm not crazy cause I take the right pills everyday.
And rest, clean your conscience, clear your thoughts with speyside with your grain.
Clean your conscience, clear your thoughts with speyside.

Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt.
Our hearts littering the topsoil.
Tune in and we can get the last call.
Our lives, our coal.

Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt.
Our hearts littering the topsoil.
Sign up it's the picket line or the parade.
Our lives.

(I bled the) greed from my arm.
Won't they give it a rest now?
