She's reformed.
Just like the neighbor's girl.
She's coming home 
Into her wonder-world.
She's moving fast.
She's a superstar.

She's getting high.
She covers up her scars.
It's the best thing she's ever had.
It's the best thing she's ever had.

She's reformed. 
Just like the neighbor's girl.
She's coming home 
Wearing her fine-pressed curls.
She's driving fast.
She took the family car.
She's getting high.
She's never slipped so far.

It's the best thing she's ever had.
It's the best thing she's ever had.
She's reformed.
She took the family car.
She's getting high.
She's never slipped so far.

It's the best thing she's ever had.
It's the best thing she's ever had.
It's the best thing she's ever had.
It's the best thing she's ever had.
