You sure you want to be with me? I've nothing to give.
Won't lie and say this loving's best
Leave us in emotional peace (Hell is an emotional place)
Mm, take a walk take a rest, a taste of rest (taste sadness)
Don't want to be on top of your list,
Phenomenally and properly kissed
We overcome in 60 seconds with the strength we have together.
But for now, emotional ties they stay severed.
And where there's trust there'll be treats
When we funk we'll hear beats,
Karmacoma

You and her walking through the suburbs
No, not exactly lovers
You're a couple, specially when you're body's double.
Duplicate and then you wait
For the next Kuwait (uwait).
Karmacoma.
