Disappearing out of sight along the open road
Into indistinct horizons I had no time to reload
Like a silver bullet from a gun, an arrow from a bow
Like an equine star you hear about me everywhere you go
All through nebulae I was racing in my mind
I tripped on the light fantastic and I've never looked behind
You slow down you slow down my lights are changing
You slow down you slow down our lights are changing
You fly so high yeah and you move so fast
You're running blindly from the past
Slow down you slow down green lights are changing

Oh changing all the time
Oh changing all the time

Looking through these hollow eyes across the great unknown
Growing greater every second, growing harder with each stone
Yeah and you who judge your freedom by the quantity you score
Would it make you any freer if you took a little more?
All that summertime I revolved around your eye
In accelerating spirals in an asymmetric sky
You slow down you slow down my lights are changing
You slow down you slow down my lights are changing
You fly so high yeah and you move so fast
You're running blindly from the past
Slow down slow down green lights are changing

Oh changing all the time
Oh changing all the time

You slow down you slow down lights are changing
You slow down you slow down my lights are changing
Well you slow down you slow down my lights are changing
