Coming to you, on a dusty road
Good loving, I got a truck load
and when you get it (huh!), you got some'n
So don't worry, 'cause I'm coming

I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man

I got what I got, the hard way
and I'll make it better, each and every day
So honey, I said don't you fret
'cause you ain't seen, nothing yet

I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man (Play it, Steve!)
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man

I was brought up on a side street (listen now)
I learned how to love before I could eat
I was educated from good stock
When I start lovin' - Oh I can't stop

I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man

Grab a rope, and I'll pull you in
Give you hope, and be your only boyfriend 
yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) help!

I'm talkin' about a soul man - I'm a soul man
