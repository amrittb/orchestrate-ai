Hey, hey hey baby! 
I want to know if you'll be my girl 
Hey, hey hey baby! 
I want to know if you'll be my girl 

When I saw you walking down the street 
I said that's a kind of girl I'd like to meet 
She's so pretty, Lord she's fine 
I'm gonna make her mine all mine 

Hey, hey hey baby! 
I want to know if you'll be my girl 

When you turned and walked away 
That's when I want to say 
C'mon baby, give me a whirl 
I want to know if you'll be my girl 

Hey, hey hey baby! 
I want to know if you'll be my girl 

When you turned and walked away 
That's when I want to say 
C'mon baby, give me a whirl 
I want to know if you'll be my girl 

Hey, hey hey baby! 
I want to know if you'll be my girl 
Hey, hey hey hey hey, baby 
C'mon, baby now ...
