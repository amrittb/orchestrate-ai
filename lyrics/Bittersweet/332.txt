Kind of a drag
When your baby don't love you
Kind of a drag
When you know she's been untrue

Oh oh, listen to what I've gotta to say
Girl, I still love you
I'll always love you
Anyway, anyway, anyway

Kind of a drag
When your baby says goodbye
Kind of a drag
When you feel like you want to cry

Girl, even though you make me feel blue
I still love you
I'll always love you
Anyway, Anyway, Anyway

Oh, listen to what I've gotta say
Girl, I still love you
I'll always love you
Anyway, anyway, anyway
