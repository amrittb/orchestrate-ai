They call, they call me the fat man
'Cause I weight two hundred pounds
All the girls they love me
'Cause I know my way around

I was standin', I was standin' on the corner
Of Rampart and Canal
I was watchin', watchin'
Watchin  those people gather

Wah wah wah, wah wah
Wah wah waah, wah wah wah
Wah wah waah, wah wah wah
Wah wah wah

Wah waaa-ah wah
Wah wah wah, wah wah wah
Wah wah wah, wah wah wah
Wah wah wah

I m goin', I m goin' goin' away
And I'm goin', goin' to stay
'Cause we be in this fast life
Can't stand this, goin' away
