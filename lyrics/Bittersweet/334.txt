Since I met you I begun to feel so strange
Every time I speak your name (that's funny)
You say that you are so helpless too
That you don't know what to do

Each night I pray there will never come a day
When you up and take your love away
Say you feel the same way too
And I wonder what it is I feel for you

Could it be I'm falling in love (with you baby)
Could it be I'm falling in love (woo)
Could it be I'm falling in love
With you
With you
With you
(With you)

I don't need all those things that used to bring me joy
You made me such a happy boy
And honey you'll always be the only for me
Meeting you was my destiny

You can be sure I will never let you down
When you need me I'll be around
And darling you'll always be
The only for me
Heaven made you specially

Could it be I'm falling in love (with you baby)
Could it be I'm falling in love (woo]
Could it be I'm falling in love
With you
With you
with you
(With you)

And darling you'll always be
The only for me
Heaven made you specially

Could it be I'm falling in love (with you baby)
Could it be I'm falling in love (I wanna know now baby)
Could it be I'm falling in love
With you
With you
With you
(With you)

[Instrumental Interlude]

And darling you'll always be
The only for me
Heaven made you specially

Could it be I'm falling in love (with you baby)
Could it be I'm falling in love (I wanna know now baby)
Could it be I'm falling in love
With you
With you
With you
(With you)

Could it be I'm falling in love
Could it be I'm falling in love
Could it be I'm falling in love
Could it be I'm falling in love
Could it be I'm falling in love
