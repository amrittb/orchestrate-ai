There's a thrill upon the hill 
Let's go, let's a-go, let's go 
There's a thrill upon the hill 
Let's go, let's a-go, let's go 

There's a house party, way across town 
People coming from miles around 
Put on your pretty red dress 
Let's go see about this mess 
That's it, baby let's git 
And go way far upon the hill 

We're gonna have a whole lotta fun 
We gonna greet the risin' sun 
All night long we gonna ball 
Until we hear your mama call 
That's it, baby let's git 
And go way far upon the hill 

There's a thrill upon the hill 
Let's go, let's a-go, let's go 
There's a thrill upon the hill 
Let's go, let's a-go, let's go 

Let's go! 

(sax & instrumental) 

Eee-yeah! 
Everybody's gonna be there 
My friends and yours from everywhere 
Oh, what a time it's gonna be! 
Come on baby, let's go see 
That's it, baby let's git 
And go way far upon the hill 

There's a thrill upon the hill 
Let's go, let's a-go, let's go 

There's a thrill upon the hill 
A-let's go, let's a-go, let's go.
