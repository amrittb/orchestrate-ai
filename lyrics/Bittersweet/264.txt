Woke up this morning, my head was so bad 
The worst hangover that I ever had 
What happened to me last night 
That girl of mine, she loved me so right (yeah!) (oh, oh) 
She loved me so long and she loved me so hard 
I finally passed out in her front yard (whoo!) 
It wasn't wine that I had too much of 
It was a double shot of my baby's love 

Chorus: 

Double shot of my baby's love, yeah yeah, yeah 
Double shot of my baby's love, yeah yeah, yeah 
A potion that I had too much of 
It was a double shot of my baby's love 

[repeat intro] 

Verse 2: 

It was such a thrill it was hurtin' me (ooh!) 
I was sufferin' in ecstasy 
She had me turnin' flips and-a shoutin' out loud (yah-hah!) 
A sip of her love and I was walkin' one a cloud 
One night a week is-a plenty enough 
It's a good thing for me they don't bottle that stuff [pop!] 
Well, my heart begins to fly like a dove 
When I take a double shot of my baby's love 

[repeat chorus] 

Coda [repeat to fade over trash organ riff from intro]: 

Double shot of my baby's love, yeah yeah, yeah
