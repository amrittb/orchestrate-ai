Baby oh baby
Tell the man at the ticket stand that you changed your mind
Go and run outside and tell the man to keep his meter flying  ??

Cause if you say goodbye to me
You know it's gonna break my mind 
Break My Mind Break My Mind
Lord I just can't stand to hear the big jet engines whine
Break My Mind Break My Mind oh lord
Cause if you leave you're gonna leave a babbling fool behind

SOLO

Baby baby
Tell the main at the ticket stand that you changed your mind
Let him know that you suddenly developed a thing about high flying

Cause if you say goodbye to me
You know it's gonna break my mind 
Break My Mind Break My Mind
Lord I just can't stand to hear the big jet engines whine
Break My Mind Break My Mind oh lord
Cause if you leave you're gonna leave a babbling fool behind
If you leave you're gonna leave a babbling fool behind
