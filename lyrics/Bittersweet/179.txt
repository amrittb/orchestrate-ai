My mother went away for a month-long trip 
Her and some friends on an ocean-liner ship 
She made a big mistake by leaving me home 
I had to roam so I picked up the phone 
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down 
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around 
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74 
My mother left a yard but I needed one more 
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks 
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks 
drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit 
Came to a toll, we paid and went through it 
Had no destination, we was on a quest 
Ali laid in the back so he could get rest 
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half 
The sun had just risen on a dusty path 
Just then a figure had caught my eye 
A man with a sombrero who was four feet high 
I pulled over to ask were we was at 
His index finger he tipped up his hat 
"El Segundo," he said, "my name is Pedro 
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto" 
Needed civilization, some sort of reservation 
He said a mile south, there's a fast food station 
Thanks, senor, as I start up the motor 
Ali said, "Damn, Tip, why you drive so far for?" 

(Well describe to me what the wallet looks like) 

Anyway a gas station we passed 
We got gas and went on to get grub 
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere 
Anywhere would have been better 
I ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em 
Ali had the fruit punch 
When we finished we thought for ways to get back 
I had a hunch 
Ali said, "Pay for lunch" 
So I did it 
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady 
She was a waitress there 
Put the wallet down and stared and stared 
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed,
"Yo, Tip, man, you got what you need?" 
I checked for keys and started to step 
What do you know, my wallet I forget 

Yo, it was a brown wallet, it had props numbers 
Had my jimmy hats I got to get it man 

Lord, have mercy 
The heat got hotter, Ali stars to curse me 
I fell bad but he makes me feel badder 
Chit-chit-chatter, car stars to scatter 
Breaking on out, we was Northeast bound 
Jettin' on down at the seepd of sound 
Three days coming and three more going 
We get back and there was no slack 
490 Madison, we're here, Sha 
He said, "All right, Tip, see you tomorrow" 
Thinking about the past week, the last week 
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak 
Hopped in the car and torpe'ed to the shack 
Of Shaheed, "We gotta go back" when he said 
"Why?" I said, "We gotta go 
Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo" 

Yeah, I left my wallet in El Segundo 
Left my wallet in El Segundo 
Left my wallet in El Segundo 
I gotta get, I got-got ta get it
