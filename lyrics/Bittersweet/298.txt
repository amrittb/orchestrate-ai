(E) Well C'mon Everybody And Let's Get Together Tonight
(E) I Got Some Money In My Jeans And I'm Really Gonna Spend It Right
Been A- (A)Doing My Homework (B)All Week Long
Now the (A)House Is Empty The (B)Folks Are Gone
(N;C;) Ooo C'mon Everybody (E) (A) (B) (A) (E)
Well My Baby's Number One But I'm Gonna Dance With Three Or Four
And The House'll Be Shaking From My Bare Feet Slapping The Floor
When You Hear That Music You Can't Sit Still
If Your Brother Won't Rock Then Your Sister Will
Ooo C'mon Everybody
Well We'll Really Have A Party But We Gotta Put A Guard Outside
If The Folks come Home I'm Afraid They Gonna Have My Hide
There'll Be No More Movies For A Week Or Two
No More Running 'Round With The Usual Crew
Who Cares C'mon Everybody
