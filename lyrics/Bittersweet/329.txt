I hear the clock, it's 6am
I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs and I've got my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you
I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
Wipe the spots off all the mirror
Don't leave the keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore

Cause…
Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know, that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you

I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
So I picked up a paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken and more people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie but it just wasn't the same
Cause it was happy or I was sad
And it made me miss you oh so bad

Cause…
Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know, that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you

I go about my business, I'm doing fine
Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken every day

I brush my teeth and put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up, and then I turn the sheets down
And then I take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my pj's and hop into bed
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it will be all right
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight

Cause…
Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
And I know, you love me
And soon i know you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
Yeah, you were meant for me
And I was meant for you
