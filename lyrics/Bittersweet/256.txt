Bust it!

This here's a tale for all the fellas 
Tryin to do what those ladies tell us 
Get shot down cause ya over-zealous 
Play hard to get females get jealous 
Okay smarty go to a party 
Girls are scantily clad and showin body 
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her 
But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter 
Next days function high class luncheon 
Food they're serving, you're stone-cold munchin 
Music comes on people start to dance 
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants 
A girl starts walking guys start gawking 
Sits down next to you and starts talking 
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove 
So come on fatso and just bust a move 

Huh, huh, yeah
Just bust a move

You're on a mission and your wishin 
Someone could cure your lonely condition 
Lookin for love in all the wrong places 
No fine girls just ugly faces 
From frustration first inclination 
Is to become a monk and leave the situation 
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope 
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope 
New movie's showin, so you're goin 
Could care less about the five you're blowin 
Theater gets dark just to start the show 
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin in your row 
She's dressed in yellow, she says "Hello, 
come sit next to me you fine fellow." 
You run over there without a second to lose 
And what comes next hey bust a move 

You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it -- just bust a move
You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it

In this city ladies look pretty 
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty 
Tell a funny joke just to get some play 
Then you try to make a move and she says, "No way" 
Girls are fakin, goodness sakin 
They want the man who brings home the bacon 
Got no money and you got no car 
Then you got no women and there you are 
Some girls are sadistic, materialistic 
Lookin for a man makes them opportunistic 
They're lyin on the beach perpetrating a tan 
So a brother with the money can be their man 
So on the beach you're strollin real high rollin 
Everything you have is yours and not stolen 
A girl runs up with somethin to prove 
So don't just stand there bust a move 

You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it -- just bust a move
You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it

Break it down for me fellas

Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry 
In five days from now he's gonna marry 
He's hopin you can make it there if you can 
Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man 
You say neat-o, check your libido 
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo 
The bride walks down just to start the wedding 
And there's one more girl you won't be getting 
So you start thinkin then you start blinking 
A bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking 
She thinks your kinda cute so she winks back 
And now your feelin really firm cause the girl is stacked 
Reception's jumpin, bass is pumpin 
You look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin 
Says she wants to dance to a different groove
