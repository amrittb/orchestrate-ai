Last night I took a walk after dark
A swinging place called Palisades Park
To have some fun and see what I could see
That's where the girls are

I took a ride on a shoot the chute
That girl I sat beside was awful cute
And when we stopped
She was holding hands with me

My heart was flying up like a rocket ship
Down like a roller coaster
Fast like a loop the loop
And around like a merry-go-round

We ate and ate at a hot dog stand
We danced around to a rocking band
And when I could, I gave that girl a hug
In the tunnel of love

You'll never know how great a kiss can feel
When you stop at the top of a Ferris wheel
When I fell in love down at Palisades Park

We ate and ate at a hot dog stand
We danced around to a rocking band
And when I could, I gave that girl a hug
In the tunnel of love

You'll never know how great a kiss can feel
When you stop at the top of a Ferris wheel
When I fell in love down at Palisades Park

Down at Palisades Park
You know it's Palisades Park
Down at Palisades Park
