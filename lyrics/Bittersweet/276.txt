Last night I sat my baby right down 
And said the talk's all round the town 
You're cheatin' while I work all day 
I guess that feelin's finally gone 
And I got so tired of spendin' my nights alone 
So I packed my bags and I'm goin' away 

But I sure would hate to lose your lovin' don't you know 
If you said good-bye it just wouldn't feel right some how 
'Cause it felt so good 
Whole lot better than I thought it could 
Honey I hate to lose you now 

Well I swore I wouldn't sit and cry 
'Cause my baby left me both high and dry 
Wouldn't sit and pine gonna move on down the line 
Well I knew just what I had to do 
Had to find me some love that's new 
'Cause lovin's so easy to find 

But I sure would hate to lose that lovin' don't you know 
If you said good-bye it just wouldn't feel right some how 
'Cause it felt so good 
Whole lot better than I thought it could 
Honey I hate to lose you now 

But I think it's gonna be all right 
'Cause I found a little girl last night 
And she said you better just move on in 
'Cause I got my rent paid through next week and I'll be out tonight 
But don't ya know I'll do my best to be back by ten 

I sure would hate to lose that lovin' don't you know 
If you said good-bye it just wouldn't feel right some how 
'Cause it felt so good 
Whole lot better than I thought it could 
Honey I hate to lose you now 
Don't you know 
Honey I hate to lose you now 
Tryin to tell you 
Honey I hate to lose you now
