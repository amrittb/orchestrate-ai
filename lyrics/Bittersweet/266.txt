a look a-there, here she comes
there comes that girl again
wanted to date her since i don't know when
but she don't notice me when i pass
she goes with all the guys from outa my class
but that can't stop me from a-thinkin' to myself
she's sure fine lookin' man, she's something else

hey, look a-there, across the street
there's a car made just for me
to own that car would be a luxury
but right now I can't afford the gas
a brand new convertible is outa my class
but that can't stop me from a-thinkin' to myself
that car's fine lookin' man, it's something else

hey, look ahere, just wait and see
worked hard and saved my dough
i'll buy that car that i been wanting so
get me that girl and we'll go ridin' around
we'll look real sharp with the flight top down
i keep right on a-dreamin' and a-thinkin' to myself
when it all comes true man, wow, that's something else

look a-there, what's all this
never thought i'd do this before
but here i am a-knockin' on her door
my car's out front and it's all mine
just a forty-one ford, not a fifty-nine
i got that girl an' i'm a-thinkin' to myself
she's sure fine lookin' man, wow, she's something else
