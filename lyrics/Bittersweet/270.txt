Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
It's finger pop poppin' time
Finger poppin' poppin' time
I feel so good
Whoa, and that's a real good sign

Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Hey baby, come along with me
Hey, hey, hey baby
Come along with me
We're gonna shake it until it breaks
Just wait and see

Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
It's finger pop poppin' time
Finger poppin' poppin' time
I feel so good
And that's a real good sign

Here comes Mary, here comes Sue
Here come Johnny and Bobby too
It's finger pop poppin' time
I feel so good
And that's a real good sign

[Instrumental Interlude]

Here comes Mary, here comes Sue
Here come Johnny and Bobby too
It's finger pop poppin' time
I feel so good
And that's a real good sign

Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
It's finger pop poppin' time
Finger poppin' poppin' time
I feel so good
And that's a real good sign
