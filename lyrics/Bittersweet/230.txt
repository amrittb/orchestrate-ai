How lucky can one guy be? 
I kissed her and she kissed me
Like the fella once said, 
"Ain't that a kick in the head?"
The room was completely black, 
I hugged her and she hugged back
Like the sailor said, quote, 
"Ain't that a hole in the boat?" 

My head keeps spinnin',
I go to sleep and keep grinnin'
If this is just the beginnin', 
my life is gonna be bee-yoo-tee-ful

I've sunshine enough to spread, 
it's just like the fella said
Tell me quick, ain't that a kick in the head?

my life is gonna be bee-yoo-tee-ful

She's tellin' me we'll be wed, 
she's picked out a king-size bed
I couldn't be any better or I'd be sick
Tell me quick oh, ain't that a kick?
Tell me quick ain't that a kick in the head?
