You'd Think That People Would Have Had Enought Of Silly Love Songs.
But I Look Around Me And I See It Isn't So.
Some People Wanna Fill The World With Silly Love Songs.
And What's Wrong With That?
I'd Like To Know, 'Cause Here I Go Again
I Love You, I Love You,
I Love You, I Love You.

I Can't Explain The Feeling's Plain To Me; Say Can't You See?
Ah, She Gave Me More, She Gave It All To Me
Now Can't You See, What's Wrong With That
I Need To Know, 'Cause Here I Go Again
I Love You, I Love You.

Love Doesn't Come In A Minute,
Sometimes It Doesn't Come At All
I Only Know That When I'm In It
It Isn't Silly, No, It Isn't Silly, Love Isn't Silly At All.

How Can I Tell You About My Loved One?
How Can I Tell You About My Loved One?

How Can I Tell You About My Loved One?
(I Loveyou)
How Can I Tell You About My Loved One?
(I Loveyou)
