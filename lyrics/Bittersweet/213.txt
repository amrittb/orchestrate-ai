Say you're fond of fancy things
Diamond clips and emerald rings
And you want your man to come through
Give him the ooh-la-la

When your car is asked to stop
By a handsome traffic cop
'less you want a ticket or two
Give him the ooh-la-la

If Napoleon at Waterloo-la-la
had an army of debutantes
to give the British the well-known ooh-la-la
He'd have changed the history of France

When your favorite Romeo
Grabs his hat and starts to go
Don't reveal the fact that you're blue
Don't break down and start to boo hoo
There's just one thing for you, la la,
to, la la, do, la la
Like Tallula just give him the ooh-la-la

The ooh-la-la, The ooh-la-la
You'd better be like Tellula
Don't be a fool-a
Give him the ooh-la-la
