DEEP WITHIN MY HEART LIES A MELODY
A SONG OF OLD SAN ANTONE
WHERE IN DREAMS I LIVE WITH A MEMORY
BENEATH THE STARS ALL ALONE

ENCHANTMENT STRANGE AS THE MOON UP ABOVE
FOR THAT MOONLIT PASS THAT ONLY HE WOULD KNOW
STILL HEARS MY BROKEN SONG OF LOVE

MOON IN ALL YOUR SPLENDOR KNOWN ONLY TO MY HEART
CALL BACK MY ROSE , ROSE OF SAN ANTONE
LIPS SO SWEET AND TENDER LIKE PETALS FALLING APART
SPEAK ONCE AGAIN OF MY LOVE MY OWN

BROKEN SONG EMPTY WORDS I KNOW
STILL LIVE IN MY HEART ALL ALONE
FOR THAT MOONLIT PATH BY THE ALAMO
AND ROSE MY ROSE OF SAN ANTONE

(BREAK)

(REPEAT VERSE 3 )
(TAG TWICE
