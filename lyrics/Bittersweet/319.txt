Hey, little girl in the high school sweater
Gee, but I'd like to know you better,
Just a-swingin' your books and chewin' gum,
Lookin' just like a juicy plum,
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, little girl.

Hey, little girl in the black silk stockin's
Gee, but you got my heart rockin',
A-wearin' that crazy skin-tight skirt and that crazy Ivy League shirt
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, little girl.

Hey, little girl, can I come along?
Carry your books; and a-hold your arm?
I'm hopin' that you'll tell me yes, because you're the girl that I love best
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, mm-mm

Hey, little girl in the high school sweater
Gee, I hope you're feelin' better
Not just like the time before, 'member when you closed that door?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, little girl

Hey!, little girl
Hey, hey, hey. little girl
Mm-mm,
