Here you come again, 
just when I've begun to get myself together,
you waltz right in the door, 
just like you've done before 
and wrap my heart 'round your little finger.
 
Here you come again, 
just when I'm about to make it work without you,
you look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies 
and pretty soon I'm wond'rin how I came to doubt you.
 
All you gotta do is smile that smile 
and there go all my defenses.
Just leave it up to you and in a little while 
you're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses.
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to;
and shakin' me up so that all I really know 
is here you come again and here I go.
 
All you gotta do is smile that smile 
and there got all my defenses.
Just leave it up to you and in a little while 
you're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses.
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to;
and shakin' me up so that all I really know 
is here you come again and here I go and here I go
