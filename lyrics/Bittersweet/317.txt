And for love's sake each mistake you forgave.
And soon both of us learn to trust.
Not run away - it was no time to play
We build it up and build it up and build it up.

And now it's solid - solid as a rock
That's what this love is
That's what we've got
Solid - solid as a rock
and nothing's changed it
The thrill is still hot hot hot hot hot...

You didn't turn away when the sky went gray
Somehow we managed we had to stick together
You didn't bat an eye when I made you cry
We knew down the line we would make it better

And for love's sake each mistake you forgave.
And soon both of us learn to trust.
Not run away - it was no time to play
We build it up and build it up and build it up.

And now it's solid - solid as a rock.
That's what this love is
That's what we've got (Yes, it is)
Solid - solid as a rock
And nothing's changed it
The thrill is still hot hot hot hot hot...

Gone with the wind
Another friend got in between and tried to seperate us.

Knock knock on wood - you understood
Love was so new - we did what we had to.

And with that feeling we were willing to take a chance.
So against all odds we made a start.
We got serious - this wouldn't turn to dust
We build it up and build it up and build it up.

And now it's solid - solid as a rock.
That's what this love is
that's what we've got
Solid (Yes, it is) - solid as a rock
and nothing changed it
The thrill is still hot hot hot hot hot...

Solid - Solid as a rock (You know it) (Well) (You know it, baby)
Solid - Solid as a rock (Lovin' me, lovin' me, oh)

Solid (Don't leave me, baby) - Solid as a rock (Well, well, why, why)
Solid - Solid as a rock (Every day it gets sweeter, now)

Solid (You know I like it) - Solid as a rock (Good, good, well, it's good, good, good)
Solid (Solid, solid, solid, solid, solid) - As a rock !
