I saw a twinkle in her eye 
It lit a fire deep inside 
But it burned so wild and strong 
I knew it wouldn't last for long 

Chorus:
'Cause love takes time 
And it's hard to find 
You gotta take some time 
To let love grow 

I saw a shooting star go by 
It blazed a path across the sky 
But the beauty did not last, no 
Some things just happen all to fast 

(Chorus)

Well some think love's a game 
You play for a night or two 
But I think that's a shame 
'Cause I know that in the end 
They're bound to lose 

(Chorus)

Oh love takes time 
I said that it's hard to find 
Oh, just take your time 
And love will grow 
If we really want our love to grow 
We gotta take it slow, whoa 

Love takes time 
Yes it's hard to find 
Baby love takes time 
Yours and mine, whoa
