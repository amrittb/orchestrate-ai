I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
They got a crazy way of loving there
And I'm gonna get me some

I'll be standing on the corner
On the corner of Twelfth Street and Vine
I'm gonna be standing on the corner
On the corner of Twelfth Street and Vine
With my Kansas City baby
And a bottle of Kansas City wine

Well I might take a train
I might take a plane
But if I have to walk
I'm gonna get there just the same
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
They got a crazy way of loving there
And I'm gonna get me some

I'm gonna pack my clothes
Leave at the break of dawn
I'm gonna pack my clothes
Everybody will be sleeping
Nobody will know where I've gone
Cause if I stay in town
I know I'm gonna die
Gotta find a friendly city
And that's the reason why
I'm going to Kansas City
Kansas City here I come
They got a crazy way of loving there
And I'm gonna get me some
