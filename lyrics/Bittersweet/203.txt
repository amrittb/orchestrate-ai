Said it is only a paper moon 
Sailing over a cardboard sea, 
But it wouldn't be make believe 
If you believed in me. 

Say it is only a canvas sky 
Hanging over a muslin tree, 
But it wouldn't be make believe 
If you believed in me. 

Without your love, 
It's a honky-tonk parade. 
Without your love, 
It's a melody played in a penny arcade. 

It's a Barnum and Bailey world, 
Just as phony as it can be, 
But it wouldn't be make believe 
If you believed in me.
