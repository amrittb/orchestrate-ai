That big eight-wheeler, rollin' down the track
Means your true-lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
Cause I'm movin'on, I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high, for my little old sky
So I'm movin' on.

That big loud whistle, as it blew and blew
Said hello to the southland, we're comin' to you
And we're movin' on, oh, hear my song
You had the laugh on me, so I set you free
And I'm movin' on.

Mister fireman, won't you please listen to me
Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll
And keep movin' me on.

Mister Engineer, take that throttle in hand
This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
To keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
You gonna ease my mind, put me there on time
And keep rollin' on.

I've told you baby, from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
You've broken your vow, and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on.

You've switched your engine, now I ain't got time
For a triflin' woman on my main line
Cause I'm movin' on, you done your daddy wrong
I warned you twice, now you can settle the price
Cause I'm movin' on.

But someday baby, when you've had your play
You're gonna want your daddy, but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on, you stayed away too long
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
Keep movin' on.
