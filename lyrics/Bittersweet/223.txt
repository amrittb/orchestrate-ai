Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday

Happy, happy birthday in a hot bath
To those nice, nice nights
I remember always, always
I got such a fright

Seeing them in my dark cupboard
With my great big cake

If they were me
If they were me
And I was you
And I was you
If they were me
If they were me
And I was you
And I was you

If they were me and I was you
Would you have liked a present too?
