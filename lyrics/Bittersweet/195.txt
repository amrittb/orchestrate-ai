Chewing on a piece of grass
Walking down the road
Tell me, how long you gonna stay here Joe?
Some people say this town don't look 
Good in snow
You don't care, I know

Ventura Highway in the sunshine
Where the days are longer 
The nights are stronger
Than moonshine 
You're gonna go I know

'Cause the free wind is blowin' through
Your hair
And the days surround your daylight 
There
Seasons crying no despair
Alligator lizards in the air

Wishin' on a falling star
Watchin' for the early train
Sorry boy, but I've been hit by
Purple rain
Aw, come on Joe, you can always
Change your name 
Thanks a lot son, just the same

Ventura Highway
Where the days are longer 
The nights are stronger
Than moonshine 
You're gonna go I know

'Cause the free wind is blowin' through
Your hair
And the days surround you daylight 
There
Seasons crying no despair
Alligator lizards in the air
