I wonder how you're feeling there's ringing in my ears.
And no one to relate to 'cept the sea.
Who can I believe in ?  
I'm  kneeling on the floor.
There has to be a force.  Who do I phone ?
The stars are out and shining.  But all I really want to know

[Chorus:]
Oh won't you show me the way
I want you show me the way

Well, I can see no reason, you living on your nerves
When someone drop a cup and I submerge
I'm swimming in a circle, I feel I'm going down
There has to be a fool to play my part
Someone thought of healing, But all I really want to know

I wonder if I'm dreaming  I feel so unashamed
I can't believe this is happening to me.
I watch you when you're sleeping
And then I want to take your love

Oh won't you show me the way
I want you day after day
