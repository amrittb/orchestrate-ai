Folks, now here's the story 'bout Minnie the Moocher, 
She was a red-hot hootchie-cootcher, 
She was the roughest, toughest frail, 
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale. 

[Call and response scat chorus differs every time. The following is simplified:] 
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-di-hi! 
Ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho! 
He-de-he-de-he-de-he! 
Ho-de-ho-de-ho! 

Now, she messed around with a bloke named Smoky, 
She loved him though he was cokie, 
He took her down to Chinatown, 
He showed her how to kick the gong around. 

Now, she had a dream about the king of Sweden, 
He gave her things that she was needin', 
He gave her a home built of gold and steel, 
A diamond car with a platinum wheel. 

Now, he gave her his townhouse and his racing horses, 
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses; 
She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes, 
And she sat around and counted them all a billion times. 

Poor Min, poor Min, poor Min.
