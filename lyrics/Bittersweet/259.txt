You don´t ever need help from nobody else. All you got to do now:

Express Yourself!

What ever you do, do it good.
What ever you do, do it good. All right...

It´s not what you look like, when you´re doin´ what you´re doin´.
It´s what you´re doin´ when you´re doin´ what you look like you´re doin´!

Express Yourself!
Express Yourself!

They´re doin´it on the moon, yeah...
In the jungle too.
Everybody on the floor, now.
Jumpin´ like a kangaroo.
So let the horns do the thing they do, yo...

Some people have everything, and other people don´t.
But everything don´t mean a thing if it ain´t the thing you want.

Express Yourself!

O, do it! O, do it.
Do it to it. Go on and do it.
Yo, do it. Give.
