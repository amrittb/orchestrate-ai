When you were 17 and I was 19 
We feel deep in love growin' up in Queens 
We didn't know a thing about love 
We was innocent, sneakin' on the doorstep to hug 
Held you tightly and promised you the world 
You gave me hickeys and said you was my girl 
When I think about it now it makes me smile 
'Cause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while 
Funny how you grow up and innocence fades 
We used to live for love but now we're afraid 
{Of what?} 
Of the darkness and bitter memories 
Lovers who crushed us through infidelity 
I promised you I'll love you to the end 
Always and forever, since way back when, uh 
You're like candy, 
The world's sweetest friend 
You taste better now than you did back then 


You will always be my candy 
[Be my] 
One day we will start a family 
You will always be my candy girl 
[You will always be my] 
(You'll be my candy girl forever) 
You will always be my candy 
[Yes, you will] 
I want your love girl understand me 
[Yes, you will] 
You will always be my candy girl 
(I'm down for whatever) 


While you suck caramel apple lollypops 
Rain, sleet, or snow I'm troopin' up the Murdock 
We used to walk down the block, hold hands 
I would get you after school 'cause I was your man 
And, any guys that want to socialize 
Just know that I'mma flip on any cat that tries 
My peeps used to say I was whipped 
All your girls said,   Since you got with him you flipped   
But, uh, they couldn't feel the feelings we felt 
Mirrors on the ceiling we melt 
I would look up at ya 
I remember the afternoon you surrendered 
We made love, 
Your temperature was high as could be 
You said,   Todd, promise you ain't lyin' to me   
And as we went our separate ways you turned back 
Smiled, I remember all that 


You will always be my candy 
[Be my] 
One day we will start a family 
[Yes, we will] 
You will always be my candy girl 
[Candy girl, you're my] 
(My candy girl forever) 
You will always be my candy 
[Alright] 
Want your love girl understand me 
[Understand me] 
You will always be my candy girl 
(Okay, take it to the bridge) 


Candy girl 
You are my world 
[Are my world] 
Look so sweet 
You're a special treat 
[Sweet] 


Candy girl 
(Mmm, mmm, mmm) 
All I want to say 
I need your love 
Each and every day 


When I'm alone in my room, 
Sometimes I stare at the wall 
And in the back of my mind, 
I hear my memories call 
For days when love was true, 
I slept and held you 
Taste the brown sugar, 
Let your climax melt you 
Candy, 
You're occupyin' all of my thoughts 
Turned my soul upside down with lessons you taught 
I could feel you 
Even when you're far away you're right here wit' me 
Sweet love strictly 
And I'mma bend over backwards to keep you on my side 
Take you for a mental and emotional ride 
Make love to your soul, 
Your heart, and your mind 
In your hour of need, girl, 
I'll be there every time 
And as long as you support my dreams 
Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team 
I'mma take you where the average man can only dream of 
'Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love 


You will always be my candy 
[You'll] 
One day we will start a family 
You will always be my candy girl 
[My candy girl, Candy girl] 
(You'll be my candy girl forever) 
You will always be my candy 
[You'll will always] 
Want your love girl understand me 
[True love, hey, hey] 
You will always be my candy girl 
{I love you too} 
(I'm down for whatever) 


Candy girl 
You are my world 
[Candy, candy] 
Look so sweet 
You're a special treat 
(You'll be my candy girl forever) 


Candy girl 
All I want to say 
(Word is bond, sweetheart, I swear) 
I need your love 
(I'm down for whatever) 


Candy girl 
(I love you Baby, I love you Baby) 
(Sometimes you gotta go back home) 
Look so sweet 
(Yeah) 
{I love you} 
Candy girl
