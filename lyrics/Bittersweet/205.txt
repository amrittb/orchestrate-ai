Thank you for being a friend
Travel down a road and back again
Your heart is true
You're a pal and a confidant

I'm not ashamed to say
I hope it always will stay this way
My hat is off, won't you
Stand up and take a bow

And if you threw a party
Invited everyone you knew
Well, you would see
The biggest gift would be for me
And the card attached would say

Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend
Thank you for being a friend

If it's a car you lack
I'd surely buy you a Cadillac
Whatever you need
Any time of the day or night

I'm not ashamed to say
I hope it always will stay this way
My hat is off, won't you
Stand up and take a bow

And when we both get older
With walking canes and hair of gray
Have no fear even though it's hard to hear
I will stand real close and say

Thank you for being a friend (I wanna thank you)
Thank you for being a friend (I wanna thank you)
Thank you for being a friend (I wanna thank you)
Thank you for being a friend (I wanna thank you)

Let me tell you 'bout a friend (I wanna thank you)
Thank you for being a friend (I wanna thank you)
Thank you for being a friend (I wanna thank you)
Thank you for being a friend

And when we die and float away
Into the night, the Milky Way
You'll hear me call as we ascend
I'll say your name, then once again
Thank you for being a...



(bah ba-ba bah, bah bah bah)

Thank you for being a friend (I wanna thank you)
Thank you for being a friend (I wanna thank you)
Thank you for being a friend (I wanna thank you)
Thank you for being a friend

People let me tell you 'bout a friend (I wanna thank you)
Thank you for being a friend (I wanna thank you)
Thank you for being a friend (I wanna thank you)
Thank you for being a friend


Whoa, tell you about a friend (Thank you right now for being a friend)
Thank you for being a friend (I wanna tell you right now and I'll tell you again)
Thank you for being a friend (I wanna thank you, thank you, thank you for being a friend)
